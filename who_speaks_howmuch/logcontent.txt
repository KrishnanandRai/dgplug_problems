[13:47] <kushal> As you all know, this is a completely free training, that also means if you don't word hard and come up with questions or things you did not manage to learn, we may not be able to help you out.

[13:49] <kushal> If you are using xchat or hexchat, you should be able to see some nicks with green dots in front of them, they are the channel operators.
[13:49] <jiteshpabla> !

[13:52] <apoorv> Okay

[14:01] <kushal> For more, you have to be in the sessions.
[14:01] <singh123> !
[14:01] <fhackdroid> devesh_verma: hey
[14:01] <ashwanig> sayan: Got it :)
[14:01] <kushal> For now do not type ! and wait for few minutes.
[14:01] <kushal> next
[14:02] <kushal> shankarj67, do you have any question?
[14:02] <singh123> I have joined the mailing list but didnot get any mail till now.
[14:02] <shankarj67> Is there any video session also?
[14:02] <kushal> singh123, check for your spam
[14:02] <bhavin192> singh123, check spam
[14:02] <kushal> singh123, may have landed there.
[14:02] <kushal> shankarj67, nope.
[14:02] <sayan> shankarj67: no, all the session would be on IRC
[14:02] <shankarj67> ok then
[14:02] <kushal> Now, why IRC?
[14:02] <bhawana> k... do i need to have a great knowledge about any particular lang?
[14:02] <ndakota> !
[14:03] <ashwanig> bhawana: It's not k, It's Ok
[14:03] <kushal> Few reasons, most of the upstream open source projects or developers do talk on IRC, it takes very less bandwidth, and works even on 2G.
[14:03] <kushal> ashwanig, Thank you :)
[14:03] <dhanesh95> bhawana: All you need to have is the willingness to learn.
[14:03] <kushal> bhawana, you may learn about Languages, but no lang.
[14:04] <bhawana> ok.. remember new time
[14:04] <kushal> During the sessions we try to make it a habit of staying online on IRC>
[14:05] <Pavan> !
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <kushal> At the end,  generally it is the same group of people who stays late on IRC and also get a lot of things done, and also become better upstream developers.
[14:05] <kushal> Because you will have to spend time to learn things.
[14:05] <ndakota> If someone asks a question, are there a set of people nominated to answer or can anyone answer?<eof>
[14:05] <Pavan> not geting mail even spam also <eof>
[14:06] <kushal> ndakota, generally the sessions handlers, or anyone else can also answer.
[14:06] <saikat195> !
[14:06] <kushal> It depends on the nature of the question.
[14:06] <geekodour08> !
[14:06] <bhavin192> Pavan, wait for your turn
[14:06] <ashwanig> !
[14:06] <ndakota> @kushal Got it :)
[14:06] <kushal> Pavan, maybe no mails from the time you joined, wait for the end of the sessions.

[14:07] <saikat195> saikatdey195

[14:08] <abdulwahababrar> kushal, If you allow me. Can I tell how to register nickname please
[14:08] <kushal> so you are good.
[14:08] <kushal> abdulwahababrar, nope, people received enough number of links
[14:08] <fihae> !
[14:10] <kushal> abdulwahababrar, http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Nickname-on-Freenode
[14:10] <kushal> next
[14:10] <geekodour08> do I have to register somewhere, i filled the google form. is there any verification mail that i should get?
[14:10] <fhackdroid> kushal: 182 nicks in the channel XD
[14:10] <kushal> fhackdroid, I see only 149
[14:11] <kushal> Everyone: you have to register your IRC nickname to the freenode server, see this http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Nickname-on-Freenode
[14:11] <kushal> do it after the session.
[14:11] <sayan> The channel has a few admins, who monitor the channel.
[14:11] <abdulwahababrar> great!
[14:11] <sayan> As kushal told, if you are using xchat or HexChat you might see green dots beside few of the nicknames
[14:11] <sayan> those are the channel ops
[14:11] <bhavin192> kushal, It shows 135 excluding ops
[14:12] <sayan> The op has the authorization to ban/kick a person from the channel
[14:13] <sayan> Also, during the session if the channel needs to go into full attention mode, then the op can mute the channel
[14:13] <sitlanigaurav[m]> fhackdroid: Actually Matrix/Riot is showing more people online
[14:13] <fhackdroid> sitlanigaurav[m]: i realized
[14:13] <fhackdroid> s/i/I
[14:13] <sayan> I will explain these with an example. kushal asked a few times not to use ! but few people did continue even after that
[14:14] <vikram> #msg nickserv register helicalspring vikramverma1997@gmail.com
[14:14] <vivek_> :/
[14:14] <kushal> vikram, nice password,
[14:14] <mbtamuli12_> :D
[14:14] <wrik003> hahaha
[14:14] <abdulwahababrar> haha
[14:14] <proishan11_> lol
[14:14] <rimshakhan> :D
[14:14] <sharan_> hahaha
[14:14] <fihae> lol
[14:14] <kvy> lol
[14:14] <bhavin192> vikram, use / instead of #
[14:14] <sayan> so in that case the the op can mute the channel, and nobody can speak other that the ops
[14:14] <saikat195> Do it in the status tab, vikram
[14:15] <abdulwahababrar> vikram remember to change password this time
[14:15] <_bhargav> so now I'm wondering how commonly does vikram use that password
[14:15] <wrik003> lol
[14:15] <shivamA1> haha
[14:15] <kushal> sayan, mute the channel
[14:16] <kushal> sayan, go ahead with your explanation
[14:16] <sayan> So this is a mute mode
[14:17] <sayan> When a channel is moderated, only voices and above can speak.
[14:17] <sayan> voices mean that the op can give person to speak in the channel
[14:17] <sayan> like kushal gave voice to batul and tenida`
[14:17] <kushal> #hello
[14:18] <kushal> Here batul can speak
[14:18] <fhackdroid> and ops as well
[14:18] <kushal> Now,
[14:19] <geekodour08> ?
[14:19] <avik> We can speak!
[14:19] <dodococo> testing
[14:19] <kushal> everyday at the beginning of the sessions and at the end, we will say roll call
[14:19] <kushal> and you will should type in your full name.

[14:59] <dhairyya> I was before ashwanig
[14:59] <apoorv> kushal: thank you
[14:59] <bhavin192> No he didn't
[14:59] <shivamA1> he didn't
[14:59] <kushal> next
[14:59] <jiteshpabla> Is there a way to make the class-logs more readable?
[15:00] <ndakota> ashwanig : Second part of your question = means (s) substitute (i) instead of (l)
[15:00] <kushal> dhairyya, batul received your message later than ashwanig
[15:00] <kushal> next
[15:00] <jiteshpabla> as clients make irc more readable
[15:00] <dhairyya> !
[15:00] <_bhargav> ashwanig: the slash commands are generally for intimating typos. The syntax comes from the linux `sed` command.
[15:00] <kushal> next
[15:01] <sayan> jiteshpabla: do you mean the IRC clients more readable?
[15:01] <dhairyya> Some ops name are in black,some are in  grey?<eof>
[15:01] <mbtamuli12_> jiteshpabla: Well, you can always use python to remove unnecessary lines from the logs. ;) Also, you'll get them here. https://dgplug.org/irclogs/
[15:01] <bhavin192> dhairyya, they are away, not online
[15:01] <sayan> and the logs are not? You can always add CSS to the logs, use Python to remove lines
[15:01] <_bhargav> ashwanig: s/linux/gnu <eof>
[15:02] <ashwanig> _bhargav: got it :)
[15:02] <kushal> next
[15:02] <bhavin192> dhairyya, you can right click and see the information, there you will see the away message
[15:02] <jiteshpabla> @sayan ok!
[15:03] <jiteshpabla> !
[15:03] <devesh_verma_> has todays class ended ?
[15:03] <bhavin192> devesh_verma_, not yet
[15:03] <kushal> devesh_verma_, Please read the channel topic.
[15:03] <kushal> next
[15:03] <anwesha> Sorry for this out of turn introduction, hi I am Anwesha, a mom, who was busy helping her toddler girl in the pee, so missed the introduction.
[15:03] <tnsittpsif> !
[15:04] <jiteshpabla> is there anything else to be dicussed in this session?
[15:04] <kushal> next
[15:04] <kushal> jiteshpabla, everyday is a surprise in these sessions.
[15:04] <tnsittpsif> How to read the channel topic? I use Weechat.
[15:04] <tnsittpsif> <eof>
[15:04] <kushal> As I said earlier, we want people to stay online as much as possible.
[15:05] <kushal> next
[15:05] <geekodour08> will the class be everyday in this time?
[15:05] <tnsittpsif> !
[15:05] <kushal> geekodour08, mostly yes.
[15:05] <kushal> next
[15:05] <tnsittpsif> How do i read the channel topic?
[15:05] <tnsittpsif> <eof>
[15:06] <kushal> tnsittpsif, which IRC client are you using?
[15:06] <shankarj67> !
[15:06] <kushal> next
[15:06] <im_mohsin> !
[15:07] <kushal> next
[15:07] <shankarj67> Is there any chat bot written on batul's side.
[15:07] <im_mohsin> which is the recommended irc client?
[15:07] <kushal> im_mohsin, xchat or hexchat
[15:07] <_bhargav> !
[15:07] <kushal> shankarj67, yes
[15:08] <im_mohsin> thanks kushal
[15:08] <balaji> !
[15:08] <kushal> shankarj67, https://github.com/kushaldas/ircbot
[15:08] <kushal> next
[15:08] <kushal> next
[15:08] <_bhargav> my question was answered https://github.com/kushaldas/ircbot this is batul's code right?
[15:08] <balaji> How to mention the others username ?
[15:08] <kushal> _bhargav, yes
[15:08] <balaji> <eom>
[15:08] <singh123> !
[15:08] <kushal> balaji, type the first few characters, and then press TAB?
[15:08] <kushal> next
[15:08] <bhavin192> balaji, just type their name
[15:09] <kushal> balaji, ^^^ or what bhavin192 said.
[15:09] <balaji> kushal, bhavin192 thanks :)
[15:09] <singh123> is there any way to divide class timing in groups as we have to wait a lot.
[15:09] <kushal> singh123, Nope.
[15:09] <kushal> singh123, wait for what?
[15:10] <singh123> this long introduction session
[15:10] <bhargav> !
[15:10] <ahole[m]> !
[15:10] <kushal> singh123, Yes, because this is introduction.
[15:10] <kushal> singh123, We are learning in a group, and a group progresses based the slowest team-mate.
[15:10] <kushal> Not the fastest.
[15:10] <kushal> Team work is important.
[15:10] <kushal> next
[15:10] <singh123> ok understood
[15:10] <kushal> next
[15:10] <bhavin192> singh123, we will learn from everyone's questions too
[15:11] <kushal> bhavin192, Correct, that is why we all learn here.
[15:11] <kushal> There is no one who can say that everything is done for them.
[15:12] <bhargav> i was out and missed my introduction. i am bhargav tamuli i have done ECE from GIMT, assam
[15:12] <ahole[m]> which is the best library for graphics in Python ?
[15:12] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:12] <geekodour08> hey bhargav, hi
[15:13] <kushal> bhargav, full form of GIMT?
[15:13] <bhargav> hey
[15:13] <bhavin192> bhargav, what is ECE?
[15:13] <kushal> ahole[m], depends, we can talk later and find out your requirements.
[15:13] <avik> !
[15:13] <dodococo> !
[15:13] <kushal> Then we can suggest something.
[15:13] <kushal> next
[15:13] <bhargav> girijananda institute of management and technology
[15:13] <ashwanig> bhavin192: Electronics and communication engineering
[15:13] <avik> what is ping timeout? and how to stop it?
[15:14] <kushal> avik, means you are getting disconnected.
[15:14] <kushal> You need a better ISP.
[15:14] <kushal> next
[15:14] <dodococo> OSS or competitive coding , which improves my coding skills more
[15:14] <avik> thanks!
[15:14] <shreyab25> I had net issues and missed my intro, i am shreya from cummins college pune
[15:14] <kvy> !
[15:14] <kushal> sayan, saptaks do you people want to reply to dodococo ?
[15:14] <bhargav> electronics and communication engineering @bhavin192
[15:15] <saptaks> kushal sure
[15:15] <sayan> kushal: sure
[15:15] <sayan> saptaks: go ahead
[15:15] <sayan> I will add points and my thoughts after that
[15:16] <wrik003__> !
[15:16] <ahole[m]> !
[15:16] <kushal> dodococo, That is a good question to ask in day 1.
[15:16] <nisha_> !
[15:16] <im_mohsin> dodococo, both. I have been doing Competitve programming and now getting started OSS. i think depends alot on what you enjoy. Fo me Competitve programming is fun and addictive as i  learn lot of new Algorithms and Data structures during long contest<eom>
[15:16] <saptaks> dodococo: I think OSS gives you more exposure to know how real life softwares work. In competitive coding you do get to learn the basics and improve your logics. But in OSS you get to learn how actually things work.
[15:16] <saptaks> In OSS you will actually get a real life scenario.
[15:17] <saptaks> In competitive coding you might be presented with a scenario which you might never face.
[15:17] <Priyansh> I too missed my intro. Sorry!
[15:17] <kushal> Priyansh, type it out now.
[15:17] <im_mohsin> saptaks, true.. Competitve programming improves problem solving ability which might help in OSS :)
[15:17] <Priyansh> I'm Priyansh from Dr. BC Roy engineering college Durgapur
[15:18] <kushal> im_mohsin, There is only one  . after the end of an English sentence.
[15:18] <kushal> im_mohsin, Every time you type extra, it creates extra heat, which is bad for the planet Earth.
[15:18] <dodococo> Thank you, can i get started in both at the same time?
[15:18] <dodococo> !
[15:18] <dodococo> sorry
[15:18] <sayan> Both of them are required. Contributing to open source helps know technologies, tools and build real softwares
[15:19] <im_mohsin> kushal, sorry. Just got used to it :)
[15:19] <fhackdroid> sayan: your take on this ?
[15:19] <sayan> that people/companies/other fellow open source contributors use
[15:20] <dodococo> okay, got it. Thank you sayan saptaks im_mohsin
[15:20] <sayan> Competitive is good, but it should be more like learning algorithms, maths and how you can use them
[15:20] <kushal> next
[15:20] <sayan> in real life scenarios
[15:20] <kvy> what is this ISP. and OSS and competitive coding.
[15:21] <rahuldecoded_> ISP: internet service provider
[15:21] <sayan> The focus should be algorithms rather than competitive programming
[15:21] <balaji> kvy,  OSS open source contribution
[15:21] <dhairyya> The one that provides you with a public IP
[15:21] <kvy> ok
[15:21] <_bhargav> kvy: OSS: Open Source Software
[15:21] <bhavin192> dhairyya, no, not necessary to have public IP
[15:21] <shankarj67> Kvy, ISP is internet service provider, mobile Sim you are using for internet in most cases
[15:22] <sayan> because, if you don't know algorithms you might be try to solve a problem, and people might have already written good algorithm for those scenarios
[15:22] <kvy> don't confuse me
[15:22] <kvy> in
[15:22] <kvy> oss
[15:22] <kvy> <eof>
[15:22] <sayan> fhackdroid: that's my take :) Open Source & Algorithms
[15:22] <im_mohsin> Competitve programming involves solving programming problem in sites like Hackerrank, codechef and websites alike
[15:23] <kvy> ok
[15:23] <kushal> next
[15:23] <kushal> next
[15:23] <wrik003__> how do i do this: "fhackdroid waiting to hear this answer"? <eof>
[15:23] <kushal> wrik003__, write this
[15:23] <kushal> wrik003__, /me is learning
[15:23] <bhavin192> wrik003__, type /me and message
[15:23] <kushal> next
[15:24] <kushal> next
[15:24] <nisha_>  Kushal, how can i improve my computer knowledge because i does not know much about computer science.<eof>
[15:24] <fhackdroid> wrik003__: magic :P
[15:24] <dodococo> I got my answers
[15:24] <ahole[m]> Does solving project Euler problem improve coding skills ?
[15:24] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:24] <kushal> nisha_, I hope this training will help you in that (slowly).
[15:24] <kushal> ahole[m], somewhat yes.
[15:24] <fhackdroid> sayan: thanks :)
[15:24] <sayan> nisha_: stay online after the sessions, read a lot, ask questions here
[15:24] <ahole[m]> !
[15:24] <kushal> next
[15:24] <acetakwas> ahole[m]::  It improves your algorithms skill
[15:24] <shankarj67> kvy, open source software, which one is available online for developers to modify the codes and improve the performance of that software.
[15:25] <SpEcHiDeR> fhackdroid, why is it displaying like this: @freenode_fhackdroid:matrix.org instead of your nickname?
[15:25] <nisha_> Kushal and Sayan thak you.
[15:25] <kushal> nisha_, like you are not from Computer Science background, anwesha is from Legal background (she is a lawyer).
[15:25] <kushal> next
[15:25] <ahole[m]> Most of the problems under project Euler are mathematical problems how do you apply them in real life use cases ?
[15:25] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:25] <kushal> ahole[m], I don't know how, I did not ever :)
[15:25] <kushal> ahole[m], I am bad at maths anyway.
[15:26] <im_mohsin> ahole[m], project Euler will help you very much in math concept as well
[15:26] <ahole[m]> Same here .
[15:26] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[15:26] <kushal> In one of the days we will learn about history of Free Software and other important parts.
[15:26] <kvy> shankarj67  ok i was  try codechef
[15:26] <kvy> but
[15:26] <kvy> that
[15:27] <bhavin192> kvy, i or I ?
[15:27] <kvy> do'nt accept anything.
[15:27] <kvy> <eof>
[15:27] <kushal> next
[15:28] <kushal> Roll Call for tonight
[15:28] <bhavin192> kvy, sorry but I want to break your habit of i :P
[15:28] <shankarj67> kvy, codechef is online competetive programming platform to improve your coding and algorithm skills.
[15:28] <kushal> Kushal Das
[15:28] <sayan> ahole[m]: you really don't do that in day to day life, but while building architectures for a product you generally need these skills

[13:30] <sachanapoorv> APOORV SACHAN
[13:31] <{tHEbIgtHEb}> Bhargav Voleti
[13:31] <dhairyya> Dhairyya Agarwal
[13:31] <mbuf> My name is (@shakthimaan), in the real world people call me as Shakthi Kannan
[13:31] <mbuf> After the introductions, we usually start with basic communication and netiquette
[13:31] <mbuf> There are some best practices that we follow in this context
[13:32] <messifc> Sorry I am late.
[13:32] <messifc> messi fc
[13:32] <mbuf> I am assuming you have already gone through the previous years' logs - https://dgplug.org/irclogs/mbuf_1stclass.log
[13:32] <mbuf> kushal, okay
[13:32] <mbuf> The second class is at https://dgplug.org/irclogs/mbuf_2ndclass.log
[13:32] <salonigupta> my name is not there in the list.....saloni gupta
[13:32] <mbuf> I am not going to repeat the same, but, I would like this to be more of a Q&A session
[13:33] <shivamA1> yes shakthimaan!
[13:33] <mbuf> To start with, when you type your name, only the first letter should be a capital letter
[13:33] <mbuf> Typing in all capital letters in written form means that you are shouting at the person who is reading it
[13:34] <wrik003> !
[13:34] <mbuf> common errors I observe from yesterday's chats include using SMS speak
[13:34] <dhairyya> !
[13:34] <mbuf> SMS should be used only for SMS, not in other forms of communication; it is considered very unprofessional
[13:34] <nisha__> iugifjdkofiid jgfiujeijkf jiuoekfol fgoigjkhg fjijfke
[13:35] <mdbk> Onyinye Madubuko
[13:35] <mbuf> also avoid typing "..." at the end of each sentence unless you intend to use ellipsis
[13:35] <nisha__> sorry
[13:35] <mbuf> next
[13:35] <wrik003> What about typographical errors regarding capital letters?
[13:35] <sachanapoorv> !
[13:35] <wrik003> they are understandable right?
[13:35] <mbuf> wrik003, acronyms are fine, but, at least do a spell check
[13:35] <wrik003> <eof>
[13:35] <apoorv> !
[13:36] <mbuf> next
[13:36] <dhairyya> What about ellipsis? Why do we use them here?<eof>
[13:36] <mbuf> There is a saying that "Writing is human. Editing is divine." So, what you write reflects about you.
[13:37] <mbuf> dhairyya, use it at the right context, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis
[13:37] <mbuf> next
[13:37] <sachanapoorv> i had the the same question had it answered
[13:37] <mbuf> sachanapoorv, okay
[13:37] <mbuf> next
[13:37] <apoorv> answered
[13:37] <mbuf> English is not our native language, hence grammatical mistakes can be forgiven
[13:38] <mbuf> but, spell check, formatting are essetial when you are presenting content
[13:38] <saikat195> !
[13:38] <mbuf> next
[13:38] <saikat195> Is writing everything in lower case alphabets ok?
[13:39] <yurii> Hi everyone, glad to join you again. I was disconected forwhile
[13:39] <mbuf> saikat195, the reason people write in lower case, like prose, is because it is readable
[13:39] <saikat195> as long as it is understandable? Many are doing so. <EOF>
[13:39] <mbuf> saikat195, you want to get the message across, not waste time trying to decipher
[13:39] <mbuf> saikat195, some of us may not understand our own handwriting at times
[13:40] <mbuf> saikat195, It is also a good practice to review your content before sending it (e-mail, for example)
[13:40] <theAtom> !
[13:40] <deepika> !
[13:40] <mbuf> next
[13:40] <theAtom> In case of mail communications sometimes people use sarcastic mails. Is it the right way to express or mails should be with minimum emotions?<eom>
[13:40] <saikat195> Yes, of course, thank you mbuf <EOF>
[13:40] <mbuf> theAtom, we are humans, and sarcasm is part of us
[13:41] <mbuf> theAtom, usually, a certain amount is tolerated in mailing lists or on social media
[13:41] <deepika> if we have to reply quick then how can we maintain check <eof>
[13:41] <mbuf> theAtom, but, do not take these things very personally
[13:41] <jiteshpabla> !
[13:41] <mbuf> theAtom, flame wars, heated discussions happen all the time
[13:41] <theAtom> Okay understood<eom>
[13:41] <mbuf> theAtom, two people can go to a movie and have two different opinions
[13:42] <mbuf> theAtom, they are not logical, but, psychological
[13:42] <mbuf> theAtom, it is okay for people to agree to disagree and move on
[13:42] <mbuf> theAtom, focus on the solution that you want to work with, learn whatever you need and move on
[13:42] <mbuf> theAtom, otherwise these discussions are going to just eat your time (unless it is a time pass)
[13:43] <geekodour08> !
[13:43] <mbuf> theAtom, trolling is generally not encouraged; the amount of distractions people have these days is enormous
[13:43] <mbuf> theAtom, focussing on Getting Things Done (GTD) is the key
[13:43] <theAtom> Yes. Absolutely true.
[13:43] <mbuf> theAtom, I had taken a separate session on "Time Management", check the past IRC logs
[13:43] <mbuf> next
[13:44] <mbuf> deepika, you can take your time before replying (don't rush, unless you are sure of the answers)
[13:44] <deepika> how can we politely suggest that we had not understood what they said <eof>
[13:44] <mbuf> deepika, "Can you re-phrase your answer/question" is one way
[13:45] <mbuf> deepika, but, people need not necessarily be polite (depending on how the day has been, or under what pressure they are)
[13:45] <mbuf> deepika, it is okay for people to be angry, or annoyed; "We are still only humans" :)
[13:45] <deepika> query them again <eof>
[13:45] <mbuf> deepika, just do not take it very personally; show empathy with people if you can
[13:45] <mbuf> next
[13:46] <jiteshpabla> Is it essential to be a part of the mailing-list? I haven't been able to receive a confirmation email yet, even in my spam.
[13:46] <jiteshpabla> *not even
[13:46] <mbuf> jiteshpabla, most discussions happen in mailing list, so you should subscribe to them
[13:46] <Cyber_freak> !
[13:46] <mbuf> jiteshpabla, the reason mailing lists (ML) still survive today because the organization controls the domain
[13:47] <mbuf> of course, one can have meetups, or FB groups, but, the content is owned by them; since we care about privacy, security we don't rely on them entirely
[13:47] <mbuf> one of the objectives of working with Free and Open Source Software communities are that you learn to be self-disciplined and can stand on your own
[13:47] <mbuf> it is a different type of mind-set, which not everyone can adjust to
[13:47] <mbuf> next
[13:47] <saikat195> !
[13:48] <geekabhi007> !
[13:48] <mbuf> next
[13:48] <Cyber_freak> Most of the mails from the mailing are in the spam folder. I don't know why ?
[13:48] <mbuf> Cyber_freak, you might need to mark them as "not spam" and the filtering engine will learn it
[13:49] <kushal> Cyber_freak, many marked them as spam, please help us by marking them not spam.
[13:49] <mbuf> next
[13:49] <saikat195> Has anyone yet received any mail in the mailing list? I am subscribed, kushal checked my email id yesterday and confirmed my subscription, yet i have not received a mail.
[13:49] <Cyber_freak> okay ! I will . Thanks !
[13:49] <wrik003> Cyber_freak, I did this in Gmail: mark it as non-spam and also enable the option (it shows soon after) to move all future correspondences to a certain tab.
[13:50] <geekabhi007> I didn't attend last class what should i do ??
[13:50] <im_mohsin> !
[13:50] <sva> Cyber_freak: also it might help to add the list-address to your addressbook?
[13:50] <singh123> !
[13:50] <mbuf> saikat195, you will receive e-mail as and when it is sent
[13:50] <mbuf> saikat195, you can check with kushal otherwise
[13:50] <geekabhi007> because i didn't get any mail regarding this
[13:50] <skarpy> !
[13:50] <mbuf> geekabhi007, go through the logs from the previous sessions
[13:50] <yurii> I have recieved mail in mailing list<eof>
[13:50] <saikat195> Okay, so we haven't received one yet, right?
[13:51] <kushal> saikat195, we did.
[13:51] <sva> Cyber_freak: but for a proper reply you'd need to add details on mailserver and mailclient
[13:51] <mbuf> next
[13:51] <saikat195> But I did not get
[13:51] <mbuf> You can check your mail settings after the class
[13:52] <bhavin192> saikat195, we will try to solve it after class
[13:52] <dodococo> !
[13:52] <mbuf> next
[13:52] <im_mohsin> Last year, i registered for mailing list. Should i do it again this year?<eom>
[13:52] <mbuf> im_mohsin, you only register once with your e-mail address
[13:52] <mbuf> im_mohsin, if you wish to register with a different e-mail address, you need to register again
[13:52] <mbuf> im_mohsin, with the new one
[13:52] <mbuf> next
[13:52] <geekabhi007> I'm new at python language what is the best way to get it properly
[13:52] <singh123> Suppose i have a doubt . So can i ask it apart from training time? Where and whom should ask doubts?<eof>
[13:52] <im_mohsin> mbuf, thanks
[13:53] <mbuf> geekabhi007, define "get it"
[13:53] <geekodour08> is there any reading materials or something as of now? I also did not get any email? are you guys talking about the mailing list?
[13:53] <mbuf> singh123, try to spend time hanging in this channel, where you can ask questions
[13:53] <apoorv> !
[13:53] <mbuf> singh123, you can also shoot an e-mail to the mailing list for help
[13:53] <mbuf> singh123, but, before you ask questions, we expect that you did some homework
[13:53] <geekabhi007> i mean how can l learn python language properly
[13:54] <mbuf> singh123, you need to tell us what efforts you have taken to fix it, or solve it
[13:54] <mbuf> singh123, we are all volunteers here, and we are here to help you
[13:54] <mbuf> singh123, so everyone respects everyone's time
[13:54] <mbuf> singh123, read on "How to ask questions the smart way" for a start, http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:54] <singh123> mbuf, thanks
[13:55] <mbuf> geekabhi007, it takes ten years to learn a language properly; read http://norvig.com/21-days.html
[13:55] <geekabhi007> !
[13:55] <mbuf> geekabhi007, practice. practice. practice.
[13:55] <mbuf> next
[13:55] <skarpy> Is there any active Facebook group of dgplug? Can I have the link? <eof>
[13:55] <neer> !
[13:56] <geekabhi007> how do i learn python from beginning to advance
[13:56] <mbuf> skarpy, I do not know of any; kushal can answer that, but, why FB?
[13:56] <ashwanig> !
[13:56] <skarpy> mbuf: I was looking for some visuals in communication, that's why
[13:56] <Cyber_freak> !
[13:56] <mbuf> geekabhi007, learn the language, and practice writing code in it; learn from other people's code etc.
[13:56] <mbuf> geekabhi007, there is no one stop solution for it; it comes with experience
[13:57] <kushal> skarpy, nope, we are active here on IRC.
[13:57] <mbuf> skarpy, what are you referring to as "visuals"?
[13:57] <mbuf> skarpy, did you read the FB privacy policy?
[13:57] <mbuf> skarpy, you have to be careful with what you post in social media? Their terms and conditions are sometimes not suitable for the philosophy of F/OSS
[13:57] <geekabhi007> can you suggest any website or book for learning python from beginning
[13:58] <skarpy> mbuf: nope, ok got it. kushal : ok fine, I am comfortable here.
[13:58] <mbuf> skarpy, people unfortunately are not aware of it (most of the time), and they fall into a trap
[13:58] <mbuf> skarpy, with our own domain, we own the copyright; it does not mean we are not active on social media
[13:58] <kushal> geekabhi007, have you seen the summer training course details?
[13:58] <kushal> At all?
[13:58] <mbuf> skarale, we are, but, we mostly use it for marketing (at least I do)
[13:58] <mbuf> geekabhi007, kushal has a good book on Python; search the web for more
[13:58] <mbuf> next
[13:58] <dodococo> You talked a lot about mentors  in the irs chat log. Where and how to find myself a mentor ?
[13:59] <sachanapoorv> !
[13:59] <bhavin192> geekabhi007, http://pymbook.rtfd.io
[13:59] <geekabhi007> ok
[13:59] <mbuf> dodococo, who is your best teacher?

[14:03] <anuGupta> All are favourite
[14:03] <mbuf> anuGupta, you are exceptional!
[14:03] <dev__> !
[14:03] <skarpy> Butter scotch gave tough competition!
[14:03] <PHI> Tutti-Fruity
[14:03] <mbuf> so you tried different flavours, and you decided on one
[14:03] <Cyber_freak> !
[14:03] <mbuf> you have to talk with different people, based on your interests, and decide
[14:03] <mbuf> just as I cannot decide your favourite ice-cream, I cannot decide who is your mentor
[14:04] <geekabhi007> !
[14:04] <ravindra> !
[14:04] <mbuf> it is perfectly fine to work with a mentor for a period of time, and then move to another project
[14:04] <dodococo> I got the point, but where to start talking.
[14:04] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:04] <mbuf> you can share your concerns, and it is perfectly fine for people to move in and out of teams
[14:04] <mbuf> but, try to work in a project for at least 3-4 years
[14:04] <mbuf> next
[14:04] <sachanapoorv> can you explain about the mailing list mechanism...? regarding the flow of the mails which i receive and the ones which i intend to send.
[14:05] <apoorv> answered
[14:05] <mbuf> sachanapoorv, can you re-phrase your question please?
[14:05] <yurii> !
[14:05] <mbuf> next
[14:05] <geekabhi007> I'm not using fedora
[14:05] <Cyber_freak> !
[14:05] <sachanapoorv> sure!
[14:05] <mbuf> geekabhi007, what is your question?
[14:06] <mbuf> Please put a '?' at the end so that I know you are asking a question; otherwise, it is only a statement
[14:06] <geekabhi007> I'm not using fedora , i'm using ubuntu
[14:06] <mbuf> geekabhi007, and?
[14:06] <kushal> geekabhi007, still not a question.
[14:06] <geekabhi007> ok
[14:06] <messifc> Butterscotch
[14:06] <sachanapoorv> can you explain about the flow of information in a mailing list ?
[14:06] <vamsi3296> Strawberry.
[14:06] <mbuf> When we all meet in a conference, we can go for an ice-cream treat :)
[14:07] <mbuf> and kushal will arrange for all the above flavours
[14:07] <kushal> sachanapoorv, Someone sends mail to the list, everyone gets it, and then who ever wants, can reply to the list.
[14:07] <Cyber_freak> 1
[14:07] <Cyber_freak> !
[14:07] <kushal> mbuf, next PyCon Pune.
[14:07] <wrik003> mbuf, yes!
[14:07] <mbuf> kushal, ACK!
[14:07] <mbuf> next
[14:07] <im_mohsin> !
[14:08] <mbuf> next
[14:08] <mbuf> With the rate at which questions are asked, I am assuming people are typing looking at the keyboards
[14:08] <mbuf> Please learn touch typing!
[14:08] <mbuf> next
[14:08] <Cyber_freak> hey ! i am using python 2 for mostly web scraping how to move my code to python 3 ? Should i start from scratch again ?
[14:09] <mbuf> Cyber_freak, that depends on what constructs you have used
[14:09] <kushal> Cyber_freak, also this is not session for that, we are reviewing the logs given yesterday.
[14:09] <mbuf> Cyber_freak, you might want to read on Python 2 to 3 migration guides
[14:09] <kushal>  Cyber_freak ask after session.
[14:09] <mbuf> next
[14:09] <sachanapoorv> my question is answered!
[14:09] <mbuf> next
[14:09] <iKshitij> mbuf: we will maintain a Github repo for record of favourite flavour of all memeber :)
[14:10] <Cyber_freak> okay ! sorry got a bit of topic here . Won't happen again.
[14:10] <yurii> !
[14:10] <mbuf> iKshitij, chocolate has still won over the years :)
[14:10] <mbuf> iKshitij, sure
[14:10] <deepika> !
[14:10] <mbuf> next
[14:10] <ravindra> How to find a project online to contribute ? How to start contributing ? <eof>
[14:11] <mbuf> ravindra, you need to go through the previous years logs on the topic
[14:11] <PHI> !
[14:11] <mbuf> ravindra, I have a presentation on the topic as well, http://shakthimaan.com/downloads.html#i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do
[14:12] <ravindra> ok
[14:12] <mbuf> ravindra, for people who need a formal book, I have one too (commercial though) http://shakthimaan.com/what-to-do.html
[14:12] <mbuf> ravindra, there is no one-liner for it; hence, the need for the above material
[14:12] <mbuf> next
[14:12] <mbuf> next
[14:12] <jasonbraganza> Reaching out to people unknown is hard for introverts like me. Words of advice? <eom>
[14:12] <yurii> I am from Ukraine, can I participate this internship? I am so interested in learning Python, and it seems to me this group is a good way
[14:13] <kushal> yurii, You are already taking part in the training by being here.
[14:13] <kushal> yurii, Welcome once again :)
[14:13] <yurii> thank you
[14:13] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, good question
[14:13] <kushal> yurii, also make sure to join the mailing list
[14:13] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, we are all here because we share some common traits
[14:14] <iKshitij> @ravindra: check this writing http://blog.hackerearth.com/2014/03/how-to-get-started-with-open-source.html by sayan
[14:14] <yurii> I have joined (it seems to me)
[14:14] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, and like-minded people; hence, depending on your interest, you will find people who share your same interests
[14:14] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, conferences, meet-ups, IRC discussions are places to socialize and share know-how
[14:15] <theAtom> !
[14:15] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, most developers who are introverts are happy hanging around these places
[14:15] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, and the tools that were designed exist for the same reasaon
[14:15] <dank-> !
[14:16] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, so when you socialize and hang around with like-minded people, I am sure you will find the project and people you want to work with and be with
[14:16] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, and people will start to open up and share know-how
[14:16] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, at least that has been my experience too
[14:16] <mbuf> next
[14:16] <im_mohsin> Is it a bad practice to ask someo one for mentoring?<eom>
[14:16] <im_mohsin> someone
[14:16] <jasonbraganza> mbuf: Thank you. grateful :) <eom>
[14:17] <mbuf> im_mohsin, yes, if you ask "i want 2 do project. tell me wat 2 do."
[14:17] <mbuf> im_mohsin, try to write something about yourself, your interests, why you want to do the project, the timeframe, your skills etc.
[14:17] <mbuf> im_mohsin, and mentors might respond
[14:17] <mbuf> next
[14:17] <mbuf> next
[14:18] <PHI> Suppose we have an idea for an project and we do not know anything about Project Management or so and do not have much skills to start developing that project on our own, Where should we go or what to do? <eom>
[14:18] <deepika> in earlier logs it is mentioned to not be language specific , (of trying out new languages too ) , how can we understand which language to select for a project ?<eof>
[14:18] <im_mohsin> thanks mbuf
[14:18] <mbuf> PHI, talk to me; I am starting to work on project management for F/OSS projects; see https://github.com/dgplug/operation-blue-moon
[14:19] <mbuf> deepika, I mention this in my workshops that it is good to know to think in four paradigms: procedural, OO, functional and logical
[14:19] <dhairyya> !
[14:19] <mbuf> deepika, it opens up your mind into thinking in different ways
[14:19] <mbuf> next
[14:19] <theAtom> While sending mail to unknown person which is the best way-calling by name or Sir/Madam as different organizations are having different cultures? <eom>
[14:19] <mbuf> theAtom, that is a tricky one
[14:20] <mbuf> theAtom, most people do use Sir/Madam, or some say "To whomsover it may concern"
[14:20] <mbuf> theAtom, but, again it depends on the context
[14:20] <mbuf> next
[14:20] <dank-> Many communities have both mailing list and IRC/slack. In that case if I need help, where should I post my query? <eom>
[14:21] <theAtom> Thank you mbuf <eom>
[14:21] <mbuf> dank-, try one, wait for a response, and then try the other channels
[14:21] <mbuf> dank-, spamming the same problem to multiple (hoping for an answe) mailing lists is also discouraged
[14:22] <mbuf> dank-, you need to give some time before trying again
[14:22] <mbuf> dank-, BTW, Slack uses IRC protocol under the hood
[14:22] <mbuf> dank-, lot of people think it is some new fancy technology
[14:22] <dank-> mbuf, there is also gitter
[14:22] <mbuf> dank-, sure
[14:23] <mbuf> dank-, it is like re-branding socket programming to IoT
[14:23] <mbuf> it has existed for decades
[14:23] <mbuf> next
[14:23] <dhairyya> Where to start with functional and logical paradigm of programming?<eof>
[14:23] <johnsnow> !
[14:23] <apsknight> !
[14:24] <balaji> !
[14:24] <mbuf> dhairyya, you need pick a functional language and logical programming language (PL)
[14:24] <mbuf> dhairyya, and do some exercises with it
[14:24] <mbuf> dhairyya, or work or real projects
[14:24] <dhairyya> Some languages are a combination of many paradigms
[14:24] <messifc> !
[14:25] <theAtom> !
[14:25] <mbuf> dhairyya, Project Euler is a good place, https://projecteuler.net/
[14:25] <dhairyya> So which languages are best for starter in this domain?<eom>
[14:25] <mbuf> dhairyya, sure
[14:25] <mbuf> dhairyya, each PL was designed for a purpose; use the PL that best helps you to solve the problem in that particular domain
[14:25] <dank-> !
[14:25] <mbuf> next
[14:25] <PHI> !
[14:26] <mbuf> next
[14:26] <apsknight> Does doing Competitive Programming helps in real world projects like FOSS etc ? <eof>
[14:26] <dhairyya> thanks mbuf
[14:26] <mbuf> We have slowly moved from communication and netiquette to project work; I am fine with it
[14:26] <johnsnow> Do tough data structure and algorithms are required in this domain or normal would be fine ?
[14:26] <mbuf> apsknight, I do not done competitive programming, so I can't comment on it much
[14:26] <mbuf> apsknight, I am more of the do it right approach types, even if it takes a bit longer
[14:27] <mbuf> johnsnow, those are good to know; it will help you when you do performance analysis
[14:27] <mbuf> apsknight, in competitive programming, you have to do things in time, and you have to meet the time deadline
[14:28] <mbuf> apsknight, at present, I am not much a fan of it; YMMV
[14:28] <mbuf> next
[14:28] <balaji> mbuf,  Where can I learn about git?
[14:28] <mbuf> balaji, start with my presentation http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads.html#di-git-ally-managing-love-letters
[14:28] <johnsnow> Analysis of what ?
[14:28] <mbuf> balaji, you should be able to find other tutorials online as well
[14:28] <mbuf> johnsnow, of programs
[14:28] <mbuf> next
[14:28] <messifc> I already know in C++. So after the training is over, will I be able to contribute to C++ projects? Because I've heard that C++ projects' codes are tough to read <eof>
[14:29] <messifc> *already know
[14:29] <mbuf> messifc, the training is to guide on how to work with projects
[14:29] <mbuf> messifc, toughness is subjective
[14:29] <shankarj67> apsknight, do competitive and this training side by side.
[14:30] <mbuf> messifc, we see there is a methodology and approach to working with F/OSS projects; we just share our time so you can benefit the same as how we have learnt it as well
[14:30] <mbuf> next
[14:30] <theAtom> In a mail communication sometimes people use one liners without addressing the particular people. Is it the right way or every time we have to address? <eom>
[14:30] <messifc> okay :) yeah I eagerly waiting for that time when I am ready to work on some projects :)
[14:30] <dodococo> !
[14:30] <mbuf> theAtom, it is short and to the point
[14:30] <johnsnow> Will this training help me in learning security related stuffs ?
[14:30] <mbuf> theAtom, most of the time, we are only interested in the technical answers; people are not interested in reading prose
[14:31] <neer> !
[14:31] <mbuf> theAtom, in mailing lists; hence, we prefer to keep it short and sweet
[14:31] <kushal> johnsnow, some amount yes.
[14:31] <mbuf> johnsnow, find the mentor who works with security
[14:31] <mbuf> next
[14:31] <mbuf> next
[14:31] <dank-> mbuf, Are side projects important? If yes, how to manage time for it?<eom>
[14:31] <PHI> What are the basic skills that may be a required to start developing a project? Like Version Control, languages, interfaces... <eom>
[14:31] <theAtom> Okay mbuf. Thank you <eom>
[14:31] <sachanapoorv> !
[14:32] <kushal> PHI, complete this training, you will learn what all are required
[14:32] <mbuf> dank-, it depends on how much time you can give to them; I prefer that you work on one project, finish it before moving to the next
[14:32] <iKshitij> apsknight: I regularly participate or practice in Competitive programming but I think FOSS projects teach you more ! CP will strengthen your Data structure and algorithm but FOSS will teach you more than that ! You will learn different framework different technologies and different approach !
[14:32] <PHI> Ok
[14:32] <mbuf> dank-, again this comes from *nix philosophy - "Do one thing, and do it well."
[14:32] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:33] <dank-> mbuf, Okay
[14:33] <mbuf> PHI, if a domain requires that you learn a PL, learn it; VC is a must (most of us use Git here)
[14:33] <shivamA1> iKshitij, i agree wid you.
[14:33] <mbuf> PHI, learn the tools used in the project; find a mentor, pick tasks, get constant feedback, finally get commit access!
[14:33] <bhavin192> shivamA1, wid ?
[14:33] <apsknight> Okay, iKshitij
[14:33] <mbuf> next
[14:33] <dodococo> When did you start  contributing to OSS ? mbuf  and kushal
[14:33] <kushal> shivamA1, What is wid? weed?
[14:34] <kushal> dodococo, 2004 for me.
[14:34] <PHI> mbuf: there are stuff that can be done with many languages, then which one should i pick?
[14:34] <kushal> dodococo, As Bengali translator to KDE.
[14:34] <shivamA1> sorry sorry with.
[14:34] <dodococo> Did you participate in GSOC? What is your view on that?
[14:35] <kushal> dodococo, That is not the discussion topic.
[14:35] <kushal> People please come back to the session topic.
[14:35] <dodococo> Oh okay, sorry
[14:35] <saikat195> !
[14:35] <mbuf> dodococo, I started with BASIC programming on a ZX spectrum; haven't pushed the code yet
[14:35] <mbuf> dodococo, will do so
[14:36] <mbuf> PHI, pick the one that you are comfortable with
[14:36] <mbuf> dodococo, I have never participated in GSoC; but, I guess most students from India have used my material to get accepted in GSoC
[14:37] <ashwanig> !
[14:37] <mbuf> dodococo, at least that is what they tell me every year
[14:37] <mbuf> we are past the one hour mark
[14:37] <dodococo> Wow
[14:37] <mbuf> next
[14:37] <mbuf> next
[14:37] <sachanapoorv> is it possible (may be in an extreme scenario), that a single programming language can take care of all the functional requirements of a PROJECT?
[14:37] <neer> A programmer is expected to know a lot of languages, how do we really get good at so many of them?
[14:38] <pr97> !
[14:38] <kushal> neer, Have you read the link we gave yesterday?
[14:38] <kushal> neer, it seems not.
[14:38] <mbuf> I will finish the pending queue; but, we can take more questions later on
[14:38] <neer> yes, it says 10,000 hours
[14:38] <mbuf> sachanapoorv, in Scala you can program in different paradigms
[14:38] <mbuf> next
[14:38] <vipulgupta2048_> I tried to install Xchat in Ubuntu and it shows "no installation candidate" on the terminal. What might be issues ?
[14:38] <mbuf> kushal, is there a way to tell batul to not take in more questions?
[14:39] <mbuf> vipulgupta2048_, you need to tell us how you tried to install
[14:39] <mbuf> next
[14:39] <mbuf> next
[14:39] <kushal> mbuf, nope, will add that.
[14:39] <ashwanig> What is bottom posting and top posting? <eof>
[14:39] <vipulgupta2048_> sudo apt-get install xchat
[14:39] <saikat195> What are the challenges to expect when trying to contribute to FOSS after you have come up with an idea ? I am new to it, so would like to know the hard things to face.
[14:39] <mbuf> vipulgupta2048_, you also need to use a pastebin service to tell us what the output was
[14:39] <mbuf> saikat195, it varies from person to person
[14:40] <kushal> mbuf, there is only person in the queue.
[14:40] <vipulgupta2048_> mbuf : After the class send you the link
[14:40] <mbuf> saikat195, some might find difficulty in communication, some in implementation, some in documentation, or some could have combination of the same
[14:40] <mbuf> next
[14:40] <pr97> mbuf, can you give those materials for GSoC?
[14:40] <devesh_verma> vipulgupta2048_ I can help you with that as I faced the similar problem
[14:40] <kushal> ashwanig, http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/communication.html#mailing-list
[14:40] <mbuf> pr97, all my material is available on my site www.shakthimaan.com/downloads.html
[14:41] <mbuf> pr97, and it has been linked from other sites as well
[14:41] <kushal> pr97, and you also missed the whole idea of GSoC.
[14:41] <mbuf> pr97, just use a search engine
[14:41] <pr97> okay thank you mbuf .
[14:41] <mbuf> pr97, and getting into GSoC is not what we see want students for
[14:41] <mbuf> pr97, we want students to continue contributing to the project for many years
[14:42] <mbuf> pr97, it is not just for the money; it is the principles and values that we stand for in F/OSS which is knowledge-sharing
[14:42] <orbot_> !
[14:42] <bhavin192> And people are still top posting in mailing list :(
[14:42] <mbuf> orbot_, pr97 was the last question
[14:42] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:42] <mbuf> orbot_, let me end the class, and we can have discussions afterwards
[14:43] <im_mohsin> mbuf, that is really nice priciples, knowlegde sharing.
[14:43] <mbuf> im_mohsin, you need to get the principles correct
[14:44] <mbuf> im_mohsin, otherwise F/OSS is not for either one of use
[14:44] <kushal> Btw, everyone, we are here on the IRC channel in the other time also, you can come and talk to everyone.
[14:44] <mbuf> im_mohsin, it is the belief that we have; job, status, money are secondary here
[14:44] <kushal> It does not have to be only during the session time.
[14:44] <kushal> next
[14:44] <kushal> next
[14:45] <jasonbraganza> In your experience, is English the lingua franca in the programming world? Any special notions of sensitivity when dealing with other cultures? <eom>
[14:45] <kushal> No more questions for now.
[14:45] <orbot_> Can you please tell the role of pastebin in communication
[14:45] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, there are programs written in native language too, but, that can be region specific
[14:45] <jasonbraganza> and if i could sneak another one in, Etiquette when educating other folks about F/OSS?
[14:46] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, in the early part of the century, there was a vote on which language to choose for scientific publications
[14:46] <AndChat-622356> How to get Mailing list?
[14:46] <kushal> orbot_, if you paste a long file here or say lines of error messages, it will be difficult to follow, many may be talking at the same time
[14:46] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, and there was a close contest between German and English; and English won it with a slight margin
[14:46] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, hence, today most of the documentation is in English; but, because in F/OSS projects, people contribute from different countries, you will find documentation in different langugase
[14:46] <mbuf> s/langugase/languages/
[14:47] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, but, most programs are written in English
[14:47] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/mailing-list-etiquette.pdf
[14:48] <balaji> What is the tomorrow home work?
[14:48] <kushal> Next:
[14:48] <kushal> As you all can see, to work with computers, we have to use a keyboard.
[14:48] <kushal> And for longer hours than many of your friends.
[14:48] <jasonbraganza> Thank you :)
[14:49] <kushal> So, the most important thing to learn at this moment is touch typing.
[14:49] <kushal> Who all here can do touch typing?
[14:49] <kushal> say yes, if you can.
[14:49] <dodococo> i can
[14:49] <_RicharD_> Yes
[14:49] <dodococo> yes
[14:49] <Cyber_freak> I can but not good at it
[14:49] <naveejka> Naveej Ahamed
[14:49] <aditya_konarde> yes
[14:49] <wrik003> i practised a bit
[14:49] <bhavin192> yes, but slow
[14:49] <shivanim> kushal, To an extent
[14:49] <ghishadow> yes
[14:49] <abhinavshirur[m]> learning it
[14:49] <kushal> naveejka, what is that?
[14:49] <devesh_verma> Not great at it

[14:50] <sitlanigaurav[m]> I can
[14:50] <yurii> yes
[14:50] <AndChat-622356> Means
[14:50] <kushal> People can not read instruction: I said to write only yes if you can.
[14:50] <poojaencoded> slow
[14:50] <mbuf> AndChat-622356, typing without seeing the keyboard

[14:51] <AndChat-622356> !
[14:51] <kushal> Do you have a modern Linux installed on your computer (may be on a vm)?
[14:51] <PHI> suggestion: use typing tutor software and practice it "daily".
[14:51] <nisha__> no
[14:51] <ashwanig> Yes
[14:51] <shivanim> Yes
[14:51] <kushal> say yes or no.

[14:53] <anuGupta> No
[14:53] <niranjana> Yes
[14:54] <kushal> anuGupta, You will need Linux for this training.
[14:54] <apsknight> Yes, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
[14:54] <ghishadow> ubuntu 16.04
[14:55] <anuGupta> I am struggling to do so for last 3 days
[14:55] <kushal> Now, everyone please install gtypist tool on your distro, and practice at least an hour for the next one week, you should be able to start doing full scale touch typing
[14:55] <kushal> anuGupta, we will try to help you after the session.
[14:56] <kushal> Remember the tool name, gtypist.
[14:56] <anuGupta> Thank you.
[14:56] <santoshShaw[m]> kushal: absolutely
[14:56] <kushal> There are many other tools available, but this one works better in my experience.
[14:57] <neer> thank you
[14:57] <jiteshpabla> gtypist
[14:57] <geekabhi007> ok
[14:57] <shivanim> ok
[14:57] <ashwanig> kushal: got it
[14:57] <im_mohsin> great. I'll do it
[14:57] <yurii> gtypist
[14:57] <kushal> Today we saw many people are asking questions about how to learn some programming language again and again.
[14:57] <cran-cg> Thank you !!
[14:57] <kushal> But, that means none of them read the first link we gave yesterday:
[14:58] <kushal> http://norvig.com/21-days.html
[14:58] <PHI> mbuf: which layout should i follow then? dvorak or qwerty?
[14:58] <kushal> Read it again.
[14:58] <mbuf> PHI, I am not going to decide your favourite ice-cream
[14:58] <mbuf> PHI, you can try dvorak if you wish
[14:59] <kushal> Next,
[14:59] <PHI> :) ok
[14:59] <Cyber_freak> thanks mbuf i was searching for it
[14:59] <akanksha> Yeah I found the link suggested in the mailing list very useful , everyone should go through it!
[14:59] <akanksha> <eof>
[14:59] <mbuf> kushal, please move this to the top-level directory
[15:00] <kushal> mbuf, I will create a link from top level to this one.
[15:00] <kushal> http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html  mbuf already gave this link today
[15:00] <kushal> Read it.
[15:01] <kushal> Also read the time management log mbuf just now gave.
[15:01] <kushal> next
[15:01] <kushal> next
[15:01] <mbuf> I will try and have a follow-up session with all of you after few weeks, just to see how you are all doing
[15:01] <AndChat|622356> Not getting Mailing list
[15:02] <mbuf> Keep asking questions
[15:02] <kushal> AndChat|622356, that is not a question.
[15:02] <kushal> Roll Call

[13:59] <prashaant> shivamA1, http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf
[13:59] <arush> deepika, there are two ways through which you can do that. A. By `bash filename.sh` B. Include "#!/bin/env bash" or "#!/bin/bash" in your script as the first line, make your script executable by "sudo chmod +x filename.sh" and execute it ./filename.sh
[13:59] <shivamA1> thank you prashaant

[14:05] <ashwanig> <eom>
[14:05] <kushal> jiteshpabla, yes, that is called archive, mail-archive.com/users@lists.dgplug.org
[14:05] <kushal> ashwanig, good question.
[14:05] <kushal> ashwanig, --help shows any help message for the given command, and man tries to open something known as man page for that command.
[14:05] <kushal> The man page many more details (generally).
[14:06] <ihp> man command is a kind of documentation.
[14:06] <ashwanig> kushal, But I have seen mostly they are similar
[14:06] <kushal> ashwanig, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page
[14:06] <asraisingh_> !

[14:06] <joyhimanshu> !
[14:06] <kushal> dodococo, yes, for different use cases, you will have to read the man pages for them, and also use them to see the difference.
[14:06] <kushal> next
[14:07] <asraisingh_> Should I choose project according to the language I know or learn the language after getting the project?<eof>

[14:07] <joyhimanshu> is there is any difference between commands used in Zsh and bash

[14:07] <poojaencoded> I missed  first day of this training
[14:07] <ashwanig> Shruti9620, You should type pstree
[14:07] <kushal> Shruti9620, in you Ubuntu install it is not there by default, so you will have to run the command given to install it.
[14:08] <joyhimanshu> so why they are different
[14:08] <santoshShaw> !
[14:08] <kushal> joyhimanshu, google first
[14:08] <kushal> and then come back and ask us.
[14:08] <kushal> next
[14:08] <joyhimanshu> ok
[14:08] <shankarj67> what is the difference between shell and command line?

[14:19] <kushal> vipulgupta2048_, those commands are part of such packages, you will have to install them anyway.
[14:19] <kushal> next
[14:19] <deepika> which packages should we install as a beginner ?<eof>
[14:19] <ashwanig> iKshitij, That is also mostly text based, you are getting the resources here anyway
[14:19] <dodococo> !
[14:19] <vipulgupta2048_> Good point there, thanks.
[14:20] <kushal> deepika, package for?
[14:20] <iKshitij> ashwanig: yes but that course also give you how things work ! Architecture basically ! Will discuss on that topic post session :)
[14:20] <kushal> deepika, Do you have any modern linux distro installed?
[14:20] <ashwanig> iKshitij, Sure :)
[14:20] <kushal> We asked people to install gtypist yesterday, and learn touch typing from that.
[14:21] <deepika> yes , i am not clear with concept of packages here
[14:21] <deepika> yes
[14:21] <kushal> deepika, Packages are a way for the distributions to distribute different applications.

[14:22] <kushal> dodococo, future topic, we use vim here in the session.
[14:22] <kushal> next
[14:22] <santoshShaw> Old IRC logs uses the YUM command. Should you continue using yum or change to dnf instead?<EOF>
[14:23] <iKshitij> deepika: After class you can discuss all these with us here ! I think you have bag full of questions :)
[14:23] <kushal> sandeepkr, in the current Fedora versions we have dnf
[14:23] <vishami3> dnf is recommended from fedora 23 santoshShaw
[14:23] <ihp> dodococo: this link might come handy for you. https://vim-adventures.com/

[14:25] <im_mohsin> kushal, Can you please after every class put the list of link we need to look for before next sesssion?
[14:26] <kushal> Can I please what?

[14:26] <lucifer> ok thanks
[14:26] <punarvasu510> im_mohsin, yeah. That'd be helpful
[14:26] <im_mohsin> because in harder to check many links in the logs
[14:26] <kushal> im_mohsin, Nope, not my job, participants must attend or read the log, and figure those out.
[14:27] <devendrabhat> i tried to run gtypist
[14:27] <devendrabhat> but there is a error
[14:27] <kushal> im_mohsin,  Then you must attend the sessions in real life.
[14:27] <devesh_verma> !
[14:27] <kushal> devendrabhat, What error? also you should have typed ! and wait for your turn.
[14:27] <devendrabhat> gtypist: line 44: line too long for screen:

[14:27] <im_mohsin> okay. Got it kushal
[14:27] <iKshitij> lucifer: yum is package manager ! In short and simple (for now) It is a command line tool used for installing and uninstalling packages (software)
[14:28] <kushal> iKshitij, please do not explain things to everyone, people must learn to search first
[14:28] <devendrabhat> kushal ya it was my turn
[14:28] <devendrabhat> it said ask your question
[14:28] <kushal> devendrabhat, Okay, sorry for that.

[13:39] <bhavin192> wrik003, wanted to verify if it exist for everyone
[13:40] <dodococo> No
[13:40] <wrik003> sayan, couldn't go through it properly. didn't have much time.
[13:40] <wrik003> bhavin192, ok.
[13:40] <ashwanig[m]> Roll call: Ashwani Kumar Gupta
[13:41] <sayan> Wow, nobody has queries, I guess this is the first time in years
[13:41] <skarpy> sayan: a repository is required for mercurial? Is it a must? I can't do the commands on simple directory?
[13:41] <sayan> That's proves that either people understood everything or nothing
[13:41] <sayan> skarpy: you need to use the exclamation mark to ask the question
[13:42] <bhavin192> !
[13:42] <sayan> next
[13:42] <iKshitij> skarpy Simple directory means ?
[13:42] <skarpy> !
[13:42] <bhavin192> is it good practice to have repos, code files in /opt?
[13:42] <cran-cg> sayan: I couldn't go through the doc throughly. Will need some more time
[13:42] <dodococo> iKshitij:  A simple folder
[13:42] <zetathon> Sumit Sardana
[13:43] <skarpy> iKshitij: simple folder
[13:43] <ahole[m]> Kshithij Iyer
[13:43] <ashwanig[m]> sayan, ai also need some more time. Could not go through the docs
[13:43] <nayan8459> naveen nayan
[13:43] <sayan> bhavin192: do you mean the source code of the project?
[13:43] <bhavin192> sayan, yes
[13:43] <iKshitij> dodococo: heard this term for the first time :)
[13:44] <dodococo> iKshitij: Youll get used to it ð
[13:44] <sayan> since people could not complete reading the document, please read it now and ask question
[13:45] <sayan> try out different variety of things, raise questions in your mind
[13:45] <AndChat-622356> Hi , sorry i am late what topic going on ?
[13:45] <sayan> bhavin192: nope, we don't
[13:45] <im_mohsin> sayan, could not read the document
[13:45] <aditya_> !
[13:45] <sayan> bhavin192: each of the language have their location
[13:46] <dodococo> bhavin192: Are you using the root account, if not, I dont think you will be able to modify it by default.
[13:46] <skarpy> !
[13:46] <sayan> bhavin192: for example for Python you have /usr/lib/python3.5/site-packages/
[13:46] <sayan> so when you install the packages the source file goes into that directory
[13:47] <sayan> if you are using nodejs, it uses something called node_modules
[13:47] <bhavin192> dodococo, no I'm not using root account.
[13:47] <bhavin192> sayan, but for our own projects?
[13:48] <sayan> bhavin192: if you are doing development, you would be using the home(~)
[13:48] <anuGupta> !
[13:49] <schubisu> !
[13:49] <sayan> whereas if you are distributing, you need to write the setup script in a way so that it copies the file to the given location
[13:49] <sayan> next
[13:49] <skarpy> Repository as in software repository containing packages, the one with .Repo extensions, not simple directory, are those mercurial commands available for them? I am a bit confused about this, can u please explain?
[13:50] <bhavin192> sayan, actually I have mounted one 80GB volume in /opt, I will consider mounting it somewhere else.
[13:50] <rkased> !
[13:50] <sayan> bhavin192: yes
[13:51] <rkased> What does cd stand for when using in terminal?
[13:51] <sayan> skarpy: I did not get your question quite properly
[13:51] <sayan> rkased: you need to wait for your turn
[13:51] <sayan> skarpy: and it's you not 'u'
[13:51] <dhairyya> change directory rkbased
[13:51] <dodococo> rkased: change directory
[13:51] <skarpy> sayan: can you please explain mercurial?
[13:51] <dhairyya> !
[13:51] <skarpy> Where can I use?
[13:52] <imranjeetsingh_> !
[13:52] <sayan> skarpy: not now, we will have a class on version control management
[13:52] <sayan> skarpy: we will explain git
[13:52] <dodococo> skarpy: Did you try googling it first ?
[13:52] <skarpy> dodococo: i googled and got more confused
[13:52] <ihp> !
[13:52] <sayan> skarpy: ask after the class
[13:52] <sayan> next
[13:52] <sayan> next
[13:52] <aditya_> difference between fork and exec system call ?
[13:53] <anuGupta> I am unable to use commands.It shows some or the other errors.If package installation is required then also I am getting error messages<eof>
[13:53] <skarpy> Ok sayan . <Eof>
[13:53] <rkased> !
[13:53] <sayan> rkased: please wait for your turn
[13:53] <im_mohsin> can someone please send me the yesterdays link for bash command
[13:54] <zetathon> im_mohsin, <http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf>
[13:54] <sayan> im_mohsin: http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fhs.html
[13:54] <shivams334> !
[13:54] <sayan> aditya_: so suppose you have a process, p
[13:55] <sayan> aditya_: so if you are doing a fork system call, in layman terms, it would be it would make a copy of the process it's forking
[13:55] <im_mohsin> zetathon, link is not opening
[13:55] <sayan> aditya_: it would have a different PID (Process ID), and there would not be two process running
[13:55] <wrik003> im_mohsin, opens fine for me.
[13:56] <sayan> aditya_: the term fork in computer science means to copy
[13:56] <zetathon> im_mohsin, try reloading it, I'm currently using it - working fine for me
[13:56] <BhaveshSGupta> Sorry Late again, Bhavesh Gupta
[13:56] <dodococo> anuGupta: What type of errors?
[13:56] <im_mohsin> wrik003, i bookmarked yesterday and now when i open its not opening the pdf and same with link shared by zetathon
[13:56] <cran-cg> !
[13:57] <Ravi_luci4> sorry I'm late,
[13:57] <sayan> aditya_: and the exec call would be used to basically replace the process p
[13:57] <Ravi_luci4> Roll call: Ravicharan
[13:57] <Ravi_luci4> <eof>
[13:57] <anuGupta> Dodococo: failure
[13:57] <sayan> anuGupta: which commands you cannot use?
[13:57] <naveejka> !
[13:57] <anuGupta> hg status
[13:57] <aditya_> exec is like context switching the running process??
[13:57] <zetathon> im_mohsin, wait I'll send u one more link
[13:58] <skarpy> anuGupta: it will not work on simple creating a text file and deleting it inside a folder
[13:58] <zetathon> im_mohsin, try this one < http://tille.garrels.be/training/bash/ >
[13:59] <sayan> anuGupta: why are you trying out mercurial? You were not given to read that
[13:59] <sayan> next
[13:59] <schubisu> what is the best practice to install anaconda to? I have it in home, but I run into problems when making things available system wide, and it feels not right to always point to the executables in my home directory <eof>
[13:59] <aditya_> !
[13:59] <Ravi_luci4> !
[14:00] <anuGupta> The first link for beginners.I am reading that.
[14:00] <im_mohsin> Yeah now this works. thank you zetathon, wrik003
[14:01] <skarpy> anuGupta: leave mercurial part(containing hg commands) for now, git will be discussed in upcoming classes, wait for that.
[14:01] <jiteshpabla> !
[14:01] <sayan> schubisu: why are you reading anaconda, was that given in the fhs document that we gave?
[14:01] <samridhia> !
[14:02] <sayan> Please ask question from the FHS document or else you can discuss it after the class
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:02] <schubisu> sayan, sorry, it's because I wonder about the location where to store that
[14:02] <singh123> !
[14:03] <zetathon> !
[14:03] <{tHEbIgtHEb}> anuGupta: I think you are going to the next chapter. The chapter on mercurial is after the FHS chapter http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fhs.html. The FHS chapter has links to the log of an older class and the the link to the FHS specification.
[14:03] <shivams334> ?
[14:03] <rkased> While reading through the kusha'ls FHS log, I tried to access /dvd after getting in /dev but was unable to. what could be the issue that I'm arriving at?
[14:03] <anuGupta> I have read the log
[14:03] <sayan> schubisu: we can discuss it after the class, there are lot of new people who might not now what is anaconda, so they might not follow
[14:03] <schubisu> sayan, okay, thank you
[14:04] <sayan> anuGupta: cool, so you can ask question from the log
[14:04] <anuGupta> Ok
[14:04] <bhavin192> rkased, you can access /dev/dvd not /dvd
[14:05] <rkased> When I do that it says, it is not a directory?
[14:05] <sayan> rkased: yes, you need to access /dev/dvd
[14:05] <bhavin192> rkased, you may not have /dev/dvd I have /dev/cdrom
[14:06] <rkased> I see the dvd when I use the ls command in /dev
[14:06] <sayan> rkased: did you try to do a ls inside /dev and see if dvd exists?
[14:06] <kushal> rkased, that is a device file.
[14:06] <rkased> yes I do see dvd and also dvdrw
[14:07] <ssach96> Sry guys but not full understanding  what we are discussing right now
[14:07] <sayan> rkased: as kushal said it's a device file
[14:07] <prashaant> sayan, I do not have "dvd" inside /dev , I have "/dev/disk" and "/dev/dri"
[14:07] <singh123> Is batul not working?
[14:07] <rkased> ok
[14:07] <bhavin192> #hello
[14:08] <sayan> prashaant: do you have a dvd drive?
[14:08] <sayan> ssach96: we are dicussing question from http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fhs.html
[14:08] <sayan> ssach96: have you read the logs?
[14:08] <sayan> next
[14:08] <prashaant> sayan, yes
[14:08] <dhairyya> when /bin contains all the commands needed by all the users than why do we need /usr/bin?<eom>
[14:08] <balaji> !
[14:08] <apsknight> !
[14:08] <ssach96> No my first day
[14:09] <samridhia> I am also not having "dvd" inside /dev
[14:09] <kushal> samridhia, It is okay if you don't have.
[14:09] <zetathon> sayan, what is symbolic link?
[14:09] <poojaencoded> I also don't have "dvd"
[14:09] <sayan> prashaant: samridhia: even if you have a dvd drive it's possible you don't have that file
[14:09] <prashaant> sayan, ok
[14:10] <sayan> prashaant: samridhia: it could be in there with a different name
[14:10] <kushal> dhairyya, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove
[14:10] <dodococo> zetathon: a shortcut
[14:10] <shivams334> !
[14:10] <shivams334> What are patch commands?
[14:10] <dhairyya> zetathon it was there in this log https://dgplug.org/irclogs/rishi_3rdclass.log
[14:10] <prashaant> sayan, ok will check
[14:10] <samridhia> i am having dev/dri/
[14:10] <sayan> next
[14:10] <imranjeetsingh_> sry the question was from Mercurial , i will ask in that class<eof>
[14:10] <dhairyya> thanks kushal
[14:10] <kushal> imranjeetsingh_, What is sry?
[14:10] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: what is sry?
[14:11] <sayan> :p
[14:11] <sayan> next
[14:11] <prashaant> sayan, i have "/dev/cdrom"
[14:11] <ihp> when we as a standard user perform any command using sudo.  In settings, the status for that user changes to administrator, then what is the benefit of using standard one?  <eom>
[14:11] <sayan> prashaant: that could be the one
[14:11] <aditya_> !
[14:12] <ihp> sayan: As this happens with me in Ubuntu.
[14:12] <dhairyya> ihp if we work in standard mood then we cannot alter any file by mistake
[14:12] <sayan> ihp: first of all I don't understand what do you mean by settings here, but you question is what is the use of normal user when the user can become admin?
[14:13] <samridhia> !
[14:13] <sayan> next
[14:13] <ihp> sayan: system settings, from where we can graphically add or delete users.
[14:13] <ihp> sayan: yes, that was the question.
[14:13] <shivams334> I just want to ask, what are patch commands and how can I use it
[14:13] <sayan> ihp: cool
[14:13] <sayan> shivams334: don't ask out of turn
[14:14] <shankarj67> ls
[14:14] <kushal> shivams334, Have you googled it?
[14:14] <shankarj67> sorry
[14:14] <kushal> or searched any other search engine.
[14:14] <shivams334> yup
[14:14] <jiteshpabla> !
[14:14] <shivams334> I didn't got that
[14:15] <shivams334> I will go through it again
[14:15] <ssach96> Is this a beginners session cause the link have things way out of my league i am a teen learning programming languages and you are already disscussing respiratory
[14:15] <sayan> ihp: so, it could be possible that you have a user on your machine to whom you don't want to give sudo access
[14:15] <dodococo> ihp: to prevent accidents, you can mess up your installation if you change permissions or delete important files by mistake.
[14:16] <ihp> dodococo: got the point.
[14:16] <sayan> next
[14:16] <ihp> sayan: we refrain that user from installing any packages and any accidents will be prevented.
[14:16] <cran-cg> So I was going through the 2nd section of the FHS and came accross static files and variable files. When I do sudo apt-get install, my intuition is that since I have been using sudo the file type has to be static
[14:16] <cran-cg> but I use that package and manipulate data without the admin access, so does it mean that the file system of variable type ? <eof>
[14:17] <ihp> sayan: dodococo: thanks
[14:17] <ihp> !
[14:17] <sayan> ihp: a lot of things, a normal user cannot add malicious code into the computer
[14:17] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal did any session happen today? and how many sessions will be happening per week?
[14:17] <sayan> ganesh_nomula: the session is going on
[14:18] <ganesh_nomula> how do i join the session?
[14:18] <ganesh_nomula> @sayan
[14:18] <dodococo> ihp: Your welcome ;D
[14:18] <devendrabhat> devendra bhat
[14:18] <abhinavshirur> ganesh_nomula, you are already in the session
[14:19] <devendrabhat> !
[14:19] <kushal> next
[14:19] <naveejka> Too many distractions. Difficult to follow the discussion. can you please enforce etiquette?, thanks <eof>
[14:19] <sayan> cran-cg: sorry, had a call
[14:20] <kushal> naveejka, problem with new IRC users, no direct way.
[14:20] <sayan> cran-cg: where was the package installed?
[14:20] <kushal> naveejka, Though you gave me an idea. We will fix it in future.
[14:21] <ganesh_nomula> !
[14:21] <kushal> next
[14:21] <cran-cg> sayan /usr
[14:21] <aditya_> does exec works on context switching method?
[14:21] <kushal> aditya_, I don't remember what does it mean by context switching method, can you elaborate?
[14:22] <sayan> cran-cg: that's weird, because if you are doing a apt get install, then you should not be able to edit the pacakge
[14:22] <sayan> cran-cg: without the root or, the sudo access
[14:22] <aditya_> context switching means to forcely switching the running process with a high priority process
[14:23] <singh123> !
[14:23] <sayan> aditya_: nope
[14:23] <cran-cg> sayan: Let me check.
[14:24] <singh123> How can i interact with lost+found ?
[14:24] <sayan> aditya_: read this one: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4205020
[14:24] <sayan> next
[14:24] <aditya_> okay thanks
[14:24] <prashaant> aditya_, not necessarily a context switch can take place based on many condition of which scheduling high priority process to the CPU is one
[14:25] <aditya_> ya i just give a particular situation to explain context switch
[14:25] <sayan> next
[14:25] <jiteshpabla> Can questions about FHS be asked tomorrow too?
[14:25] <kushal> jiteshpabla, Yes
[14:25] <sayan> jiteshpabla: yes
[14:25] <kushal> Btw, everyone this is the FAQ: http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html
[14:25] <sayan> jiteshpabla: you also don't need to wait for the session, you can ask after the class.
[14:25] <kushal> Which I forgot to share before :(
[14:26] <jiteshpabla> kushal sayan: Ok, thank you
[14:26] <sayan> jiteshpabla: but if you ask in class other people can also interact
[14:26] <sayan> next
[14:26] <samridhia> I was having a doubt with what does recursive create directories and remove directory mean?
[14:27] <acetakwas> samridhia::  It means the change will be effected on child folders
[14:27] <kushal> samridhia, think like this /a/b/c/d
[14:27] <sayan> I did not understand what did you mean by recursive create directories
[14:27] <acetakwas> "child folders" of the folder you are making a change to.
[14:27] <kushal> Now if you remove a recursively, it will not only remove a but all the childs
[14:28] <kushal> sayan, I guess mkdir -p a/b/c/d
[14:28] <jiteshpabla> sayan: that's great, thanks!
[14:28] <sayan> kushal: oh ok
[14:28] <samridhia> kushal: got it
[14:28] <sayan> next
[14:28] <singh123> How can i interact with lost+found?
[14:28] <cran-cg> sayan: Say I used dpkg -L tree. The location shows me /usr/bin /usr/share/
[14:29] <cran-cg> *console logs
[14:29] <cran-cg> Am I giving a wrong command sayan?
[14:29] <ganesh_nomula> !
[14:29] <dodococo> singh123:  The exact same question https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/18154/236016
[14:30] <sayan> singh123: if you have stuff in there, you can access it
[14:30] <sayan> I haven't accessed lost+found myself, afaik it usually needed after a crash recovery
[14:31] <sayan> cran-cg: I don't know about dpkg -L, that's ubuntu specific
[14:31] <sayan> cran-cg: let's see this after the class
[14:31] <sayan> cran-cg: ping me
[14:31] <sayan> next
[14:31] <singh123> thanks dodococo,sayan
[14:31] <sayan> cran-cg: but the basic idea is, you should not be able to access  :)
[14:31] <sayan> next
[14:31] <balaji> sayan, Even I am having problem which I can not access anything inside /dev. But When I do ls I can see the folders. Whenever I try to do cd inside that it says dvd(also cdrom) not a directory
[14:32] <sayan> balaji: that is because it is not a directory
[14:32] <dodococo> balaji: They are files
[14:32] <sayan> those are files
[14:32] <cran-cg> sayan: Thanks :))
[14:32] <sayan> next
[14:32] <balaji> then how can go inside that
[14:32] <apsknight> Why Github is preferred more than Gitlab and Bitbucket ?
[14:32] <dhairyya> balaji just the way you access files
[14:33] <ganesh_nomula> !
[14:33] <apoorv> ?
[14:33] <dodococo> balaji: mount something there and then try cd
[14:33] <sayan> apsknight: is Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket related to FHS in any way?
[14:34] <shankarj67> apsknight, mechanism is same but github is popular now a days.
[14:34] <sayan> balaji: when you insert the drive you can access them, you can also alternatively mount the drive and access it
[14:34] <sayan> in that case you can `cd` into it
[14:34] <balaji> sayan,  dhairyya, dodococo Thanks . Will try that
[14:34] <sayan> next
[14:34] <ihp> Then, why should we use standard user cause we might need sudo access many times?  Asking because in the logs they joked to try rm -rf / (which I never won't) to all root users. <eof>
[14:35] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal this is my first session actually. So, sessions are something where we have to discuss about homeworks?
[14:35] <sayan> ihp: to do day to day stuffs
[14:35] <ihp> sayan: Do you use standard user or administrator user?  Just to know personal preference.
[14:36] <sayan> ihp: the confusion is because you have access to both, consider a server where I don't have the access to root
[14:36] <sayan> so in that case I am a limited user, I cannot install malicious packages, change config files
[14:37] <kushal> ganesh_nomula, or learn a new thing if there is any live thing.
[14:37] <sayan> ihp: the normal user, I rarely even use sudo
[14:37] <ihp> then how do you install softwares
[14:38] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal where can i find all the logs?
[14:38] <kushal> ganesh_nomula, https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2017/
[14:38] <sayan> ihp: i.e. whenever I use sudo that is for installing softwares
[14:38] <sayan> next
[14:38] <devendrabhat> As i joined the session late, can you please tell which all topics have been covered till now, n also links
[14:38] <sayan> devendrabhat: please the word is *and*
[14:38] <ihp> sayan: Ok. :)
[14:38] <kushal> ganesh_nomula, Also only ask when it is your turn.
[14:38] <ihp> !
[14:38] <devendrabhat> sorry*
[14:39] <sayan> devendrabhat: we are discussing http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fhs.html
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <ihp> I am really confused between hard link, soft links
[14:39] <ihp> why do we need these two different concepts?
[14:39] <sayan> ihp: what is your confusion?
[14:39] <ihp> and what is benefit over copy command?
[14:40] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal, i couldnât find day 3 logs will it take time to upload. and sure ill ask when itâs my turn.
[14:40] <sayan> ihp: well the benefit of the copy command is to copy, I guess
[14:40] <dodococo> ihp: soft link is the shortcut and the hard link is the replica, if you modify the replica it modifies the original file.
[14:40] <ganesh_nomula> and how many sessions will be held per week?
[14:41] <kushal> ganesh_nomula, you are still asking in the middle of the session
[14:41] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal batul told me to ask
[14:41] <kushal> ganesh_nomula, I can see three logs at https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2017/
[14:41] <kushal> ganesh_nomula, Okay, my mistake.
[14:41] <sayan> dodococo: ihp's question is "Why do they exists"
[14:41] <ihp> sayan: do hard link occupies space at two place in disk, like copy?
[14:42] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal thatâs okay. Will the sessions be conducted everyday for 3 months?
[14:42] <kushal> ganesh_nomula, No
[14:42] <sayan> afaik, hardlink does not occupy space
[14:43] <dodococo> sayan: the first question he asked was that he was confused, so tried to explain. My bad
[14:43] <sayan> dodococo: no issues :)
[14:43] <ihp> sayan: and neither do the soft link, right?
[14:43] <kushal> ihp, Have you searched about it?
[14:43] <kushal> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/88423/why-do-hard-links-seem-to-take-the-same-space-as-the-originals
[14:43] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal done thank you so much :D
[14:44] <sayan> oops, sorry I mean hard links
[14:44] <sayan> s/hard/soft/
[14:44] <sayan> :(
[14:44] <ihp> kushal: tried but got more confused.  BTW, thanks for the link
[14:44] <im_mohsin> sayan, hardlinks do occupy space right because it will copy all the content in a separate file. Correct me if i'm wrong
[14:44] <anuGupta> !
[14:45] <kushal> ihp, also read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8337878/do-hard-links-or-soft-links-take-any-space-in-the-filesystem
[14:45] <jasonbraganza> No im_mohsin. not quite. Read kushalâs links
[14:45] <kushal> im_mohsin, also read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link
[14:45] <sayan> im_mohsin: well the think is both take space

[14:46] <anuGupta> Should we use standard user or administrator user?
[14:46] <anuGupta> <EOF>
[14:46] <sayan> anuGupta: normal user
[14:46] <singh123> cd / means we are superuser?
[14:47] <sayan> singh123: no, you can do cd / even if you are not superuser
[14:47] <sayan> next
[14:47] <dodococo> singh123: No, goes to root directory
[14:47] <anuGupta> Sayan,ok
[14:47] <kushal> singh123, no, means you are going to the root directory
[14:47] <wrik003> singh123, i think it is to go to te root directory.
[14:47] <wrik003> s/te/the
[14:48] <sayan> singh123: right, don't confuse between root directory and root user
[14:48] <singh123> understood sayan

[14:48] <sayan> next
[14:48] <ahole[m]> No there is another home dir for root it's /root.
[14:48] <ahole[m]> anuGupta
[14:48] <singh123> thanks
[14:48] <anuGupta> I am unable to access files under directory .<eof>
[14:49] <dodococo> ahole[m]: I think thats roots home directory
[14:49] <kushal> anuGupta, ?
[14:49] <kushal> anuGupta, which directory?
[14:49] <dhairyya> dodoco you are right
[14:49] <ahole[m]> dodococo: yes.
[14:49] <bhavin192> kushal, I think "."
[14:50] <sayan> btw, can you tell me the difference between cd .. & cd -?
[14:50] <kushal> bhavin192, But anuGupta has to confirm :)
[14:50] <anuGupta> Dev
[14:50] <kushal> anuGupta, ?
[14:50] <sayan> anuGupta: cd /dev
[14:50] <kushal> anuGupta, can you please type pwd, and tell us the answer?
[14:50] <anuGupta> Kushal,Dev
[14:51] <kushal> anuGupta, There is no Dev
[14:51] <jasonbraganza> sayan cd.. goes to the parent folder. cd - goes to the last known folder
[14:51] <sayan> anuGupta: if you are trying to access cd /Dev that won't work
[14:51] <dhairyya> cd - goes to the last working directory
[14:51] <anuGupta> No it's working sayan
[14:51] <sayan> anuGupta: cool
[14:52] <anuGupta> But what about /dev/sda
[14:52] <sayan> jasonbraganza: dhairyya yup :)
[14:52] <sayan> anuGupta: you cannot access those, those are files, you just need to know that within /dev resides device files
[14:53] <anuGupta> Ok
[14:53] <im_mohsin> sayan, cd.. goes one level up and cd - shows user path and takes back to home
[14:53] <kushal> anuGupta, /dev/sda is your main hard drive.
[14:54] <kushal> im_mohsin, nope
[14:54] <singh123> !
[14:54] <kushal> read the answer from jasonbraganza dhairyya

[14:54] <im_mohsin> kushal, what does last known folder means?
[14:54] <jasonbraganza> im_mohsin easier if you try it
[14:55] <kushal> jasonbraganza, :)
[14:55] <singh123> Why there are different colours folder in dev?
[14:55] <sayan> im_mohsin: the folder from where you changed the directory
[14:55] <Raut> Hello, its my first session. Up till now i have understood that we are discussing yesterday's homework, what should we prepare for the next session? <eof>

[14:56] <poojaencoded> why i am not able to understand?
[14:57] <sayan> So, for the next session, re-read the FHS document again
[14:57] <ganesh_nomula> !
[14:57] <sayan> poojaencoded: did you read the logs?
[14:57] <sayan> next
[14:57] <dhairyya> !
[14:57] <sayan> next
[14:57] <poojaencoded> yes
[14:57] <dhairyya> sayan you mean the logs or the pdf?<eof>
[14:57] <im_mohsin> jasonbraganza, i tried from home so it was taking me back to home. so thought its just like cd.
[14:58] <sayan> dhairyya: can you quote the complete line where you saw this one?
[14:58] <dodococo> im_mohsin: Try from something other than home
[14:58] <jiteshpabla> I'm leaving the class in between.
[14:58] <singh123> !
[14:58] <poojaencoded> i read about first class ,i understood
[14:58] <ganesh_nomula> @kushal Iâm getting an error while updating fedora.
[14:58] <im_mohsin> dodococo, yeah tried it now :)
[14:58] <sayan> ganesh_nomula: ask the questions after the class
[14:58] <dhairyya> sayan you asked us to read the document
[14:59] <ganesh_nomula> @sayan okay :)
[14:59] <dhairyya> I meant reread the FHS document
[14:59] <sayan> dhairyya: oh, sorry, I mean whatever you have here: http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fhs.html
[14:59] <dhairyya> okay thanks
[14:59] <sayan> next
[15:00] <singh123> What is linked file?
[15:01] <sayan> singh123: a hard link or a soft link file
[15:01] <singh123> ok got it,thanks
[15:01] <sayan> kushal: have you passed them the smart questions link to read?
[15:02] <dodococo> He did sayan
[15:02] <sayan> Anybody from the class can answer the question ^^
[15:02] <sayan> But just repeating again, if you haven't read this: read this again: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:03] <ashwanig> !
[15:03] <dhairyya> linked files are similar to shortcuts in windows
[15:03] <sayan> next
[15:03] <im_mohsin> !
[15:03] <ashwanig> In rishi's first class he mentions that if the section number is known then we can do this $ man 2 open
[15:03] <ashwanig> But how do to know which section number is for which command?
[15:03] <ashwanig> <eof>
[15:03] <schubisu> I have to leave early today, sorry
[15:04] <sayan> ashwanig: so there is special utility for each section numbers
[15:04] <dodococo> ashwanig: man -f application_name gives the number
[15:04] <sayan> which goes from 1-8
[15:04] <ashwanig> sayan, why only 1-8?
[15:05] <sayan> ashwanig: they all serve a different purpose
[15:05] <ashwanig> and do I have to remember the section number?
[15:05] <sayan> ashwanig: http://www.december.com/unix/ref/mansec.html
[15:05] <sayan> check this
[15:06] <ashwanig> sayan, Okay
[15:06] <sayan> ashwanig: now, an example man 3 printf
[15:07] <sayan> and man 1 printf
[15:07] <sayan> try this and see the difference
[15:07] <sayan> next
[15:07] <sayan> ashwanig: you can also tally with the table

[13:33] <asraisingh> ok
[13:33] <santoshShaw> vim
[13:34] <kushal> This is a tool for which people may start a new war, millions of hours already waster to figure out which one is better.
[13:34] <ahole[m]> Atom
[13:34] <ahole[m]> nano
[13:34] <asraisingh> sublime
[13:34] <dhairyya> emacs and gedit are missing out

[13:34] <ghishadow> vim vs emacs :)
[13:35] <ahole[m]> asraisingh: I guess it's lime in Linux.
[13:35] <ahole[m]> Sublime is windows
[13:35] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[13:35] <kushal> This is better.
[13:36] <kushal> In our session we will only learn about vim, feel free to learn all the other ones of your own time.
[13:38] <kushal> Let us all open our terminal
[13:38] <kushal> Today we all will type along, means it will be a live session
[13:40] <kushal> Or we don't.
[13:40] <kushal> I will keep the session running, but you follow from the log here https://dgplug.org/irclogs/kushal_vi_1stclass.log
[13:40] <zetathon__> Yes, live session
[13:41] <santoshShaw> ok
[13:41] <kushal> Search for 23:07:33 and then read from there.
[13:41] <kushal> If you have any doubt, type ! here, we will take questions
[13:41] <Raut> Alright

[13:43] <kushal> next
[13:43] <theAtom> by default vi editor will be present in all linux or we have to install?<eom>
[13:43] <avik> ok thanks kushal <eof>

[13:44] <theAtom> kushal, okay.
[13:44] <deepika> !
[13:44] <kushal> next
[13:44] <deepika> What happens when we edit in .vimrc
[13:45] <SpEcHiDeR> !
[13:45] <neer> !
[13:45] <kushal> deepika, vimrc is the configuration file for vim. Skip that for now, edit any other file.
[13:45] <kushal> like
[13:45] <kushal> vim hello.txt
[13:45] <skarpy> !
[13:45] <kushal> next
[13:45] <Raut> !
[13:46] <deepika> okay thanks <eof>
[13:46] <atisayajain> !
[13:46] <SpEcHiDeR> In my system, there are both vi and vim. vi is a symlink of ex. Is ex used in anywhere?
[13:46] <apoorv> !
[13:47] <soumam_> !
[13:48] <kushal> SpEcHiDe, maybe, I don't know.
[13:48] <kushal> next
[13:48] <neer> What is the difference between vi and vim, it looks the same?
[13:49] <kushal> neer, for most systems yes, but vi used to be the old one, vim is newer.
[13:49] <kushal> vi enhanced
[13:49] <kushal> next
[13:49] <skarpy> So, do we have to refer the whole thing from the log? And this is just going to be a q/a session? <eom>
[13:50] <poojaencoded> !
[13:50] <kushal> skarpy, you will have to try the commands from the log, if you have questions, we will take it here.
[13:50] <kushal> next
[13:50] <Raut> kushal: Are we suppose to keep on following the log and carry out steps accordingly? When should we stop?
[13:50] <ashwanig> !
[13:50] <kushal> Raut, When the logs end.
[13:50] <kushal> next
[13:50] <asraisingh> !
[13:51] <arush> !
[13:51] <atisayajain> My question has been asked and answered already, thanks.
[13:51] <kushal> next
[13:51] <kushal> next
[13:51] <soumam_> why shall we use this? i mean we can use normal leafpad also to write without using commands?
[13:52] <apoorv> no doubt
[13:52] <poojaencoded> ooja@pooja-Inspiron-3521 ~ $ vim hello.txt
[13:52] <poojaencoded> The program 'vim' can be found in the following packages:
[13:52] <poojaencoded>  * vim
[13:52] <poojaencoded>  * vim-gnome
[13:52] <poojaencoded>  * vim-tiny
[13:52] <poojaencoded>  * vim-athena
[13:52] <poojaencoded>  * vim-gtk
[13:52] <poojaencoded>  * vim-nox
[13:52] <poojaencoded> Try: sudo apt-get install <selected package>
[13:52] <santoshShaw> !
[13:52] <zetathon__> sudo apt-get install vim
[13:52] <poojaencoded> i have to install the package?
[13:52] <zetathon__> yup
[13:52] <dhairyya> !
[13:52] <poojaencoded> thanks
[13:52] <kushal> poojaencoded, 2 things, you are talking out of order, also use a pastebin like paste.fedoraproject.org to show so many lines
[13:52] <kushal> soumam_, correct, but think about a situation where you will have to login to a server and work
[13:53] <kushal> and also vim is very powerful
[13:53] <iKshitij> poojaencoded: yes and chhose vim
[13:53] <kushal> next
[13:53] <zetathon__> !
[13:53] <soumam_> ok, kushal !we will learn its power :)
[13:53] <kushal> poojaencoded, yes, install vim
[13:53] <kushal> next
[13:53] <ashwanig> Edit mode turns on with a/d/w keys also. Why is that?
[13:54] <poojaencoded> done
[13:54] <kushal> ashwanig, each of those keys have some meaning, you will learn about those slowly.
[13:54] <kushal> next
[13:54] <asraisingh> kushal, yesterday i'm playing vim adventure there is B and b command two commands but i am not able to figure out the difference. Please Help!

[13:54] <kushal> ashwanig, Keep reading
[13:55] <ashwanig> kushal, Yes doing that. :)
[13:55] <kushal> asraisingh, Have you searched the same question?
[13:55] <kushal> asraisingh, when I searched, I found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14390519/whats-the-difference-between-b-and-b-in-vim
[13:55] <asraisingh> yes already did. but not able to understand
[13:55] <kushal> asraisingh, Point that I also never knew the difference.
[13:55] <asraisingh> ok, i have a read
[13:55] <kushal> asraisingh, read the answer from the link I gave
[13:56] <asraisingh> ok, thanks

[13:58] <zetathon__> ok
[13:59] <kvy> !
[13:59] <kushal> iKshitij, noting that I know about, expect :x is one character less to type :)
[13:59] <kushal> arush, ask
[14:00] <kushal> next
[14:00] <asraisingh> kushal, Is working with hjkl is more preferable or with up-down-key-left-right key during editing in vim?
[14:00] <kushal> asraisingh, most of the vim users use hjkl
[14:00] <kushal> asdofindia, but again, personal choice

[14:03] <kushal> dnf remove vim-minimal
[14:03] <kushal> dnf install vim sudo -y
[14:03] <kushal> asraisingh, https://www.flickr.com/photos/kent-chen/6825667892/ will give you more details :)
[14:03] <kushal> next
[14:03] <kvy> I do not have any question i just have a little request please send all the link for home work at the end of the session so i will only read those only.
[14:03] <kushal> kvy, Nope, we will not do that.
[14:04] <kvy> can i ask why?
[14:04] <dodococo> !
[14:04] <kushal> kvy, It is the duty of the participants to read the logs.
[14:04] <Cyber_freak> !
[14:04] <kvy> i am reading
[14:04] <kushal> kvy, otherwise people may prefer to skip, which is okay, but you have to do the work.
[14:04] <kushal> We can not do more.
[14:04] <kushal> next
[14:04] <kvy> but still i confuse here are a lot of links
[14:04] <im_mohsin> kushal, Can we change the character keys to move left,right,up down?
[14:04] <ashwanig> !
[14:04] <kushal> im_mohsin, means?
[14:05] <saikat_> kushal, getting this error on 1st command: Error: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: sudo.
[14:05] <ahole[m]> kvy: what you can do is write a script which filters the URLs alone from the log.
[14:05] <asraisingh> kushal, oh got it.
[14:05] <kushal> saikat_, not error, it is asking to press Y or N
[14:05] <kushal> press y
[14:05] <kushal> next
[14:05] <im_mohsin> like instead of having 'h' to move left one character, Can we change?
[14:05] <dodococo> Whats a visual mode?
[14:05] <kvy> ahole[m]   no just the homework
[14:05] <kushal> im_mohsin, I don't know if that is possible
[14:05] <vipulgupta2048_> ahole[m], sounds interesting will try for sure
[14:06] <Cyber_freak> Out of context but where are these buffer editors used ? I know in servers we use them because they are light weight.
[14:06] <saikat_> kushal, it does not say type y/n. pressed y, nothing happens
[14:06] <im_mohsin> ok. Thanks. i thought it would good to arrange keys in sequence
[14:06] <kushal> saikat_, dnf remove sudo vim-minimal
[14:06] <kushal> what does it do?
[14:07] <kushal> next
[14:07] <praveenkumar> Cyber_freak: you can use it day to day job also, depend on your preference
[14:07] <kushal> im_mohsin, Nope, there is a reason for those keys :)
[14:07] <kushal> dodococo, wait for that answer
[14:07] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:07] <dodococo> im_mohsin: I think you can edit vimrc to remap your keys
[14:08] <anupamas> !
[14:08] <soumam_> ahole[m]: copying the logs in a txt file and just give a search like find in notepad will also do.In command line we can use grep for http
[14:08] <saikat_> kushal, this error: [root@localhost ~]# dnf remove sudo vim-minimal
[14:08] <saikat_> Dependencies resolved.
[14:08] <saikat_> Error: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: sudo.
[14:08] <saikat_> [root@localhost ~]# ^C
[14:08] <saikat_> Will get the pastebin after this session
[14:08] <dhairyya> stop flooding please. I cannot follow
[14:08] <ahole[m]> soumam_:  You'll have to run it everyday.
[14:08] <schubisu> kushal, saikat_ it's the same on my fedora 26 beta VM. I think you can do sudo dnf remove vim-minimal without root, then become root and do the second line
[14:08] <praveenkumar> dodococo: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/visual.html#Visual it will contain document around visual mode.
[14:09] <kushal> saikat_, you don't have to get the pastebin, just paste in paste.fedoraproject.org
[14:09] <kushal> saikat_, are you on F25?
[14:09] <saikat_> yes
[14:09] <praveenkumar> saikat_: use sudo dnf remove vim-minimal
[14:09] <praveenkumar> saikat_: you did it wrong
[14:09] <soumam_> ahole[m], thatÂ´s a 2 second job man :)
[14:09] <iKshitij> saikat_: you are removing sudo! :)
[14:10] <ahole[m]> soumam_: I guess I am the lazy one.
[14:10] <kushal> iKshitij, yes, that will happen in this case
[14:10] <saikat_> praveenkumar, same error with your command
[14:11] <im_mohsin> dodococo, i look into it :)
[14:11] <praveenkumar> saikat_: can you use pastebin and put what you tried and also error.
[14:11] <saikat_> praveenkumar, okay
[14:11] <vipulgupta2048_> sounam, making a script and executing it would be a good learning curve if not done already
[14:12] <zetathon__> !
[14:12] <kushal> dodococo, I will show in few minutes
[14:12] <kushal> next
[14:12] <ashwanig> This is regarding the change and delete. How can I press cw? When I press c the edit mode is turned on.<eom>
[14:12] <kushal> saikat_, and you also wait
[14:12] <kushal> ashwanig, it should not
[14:13] <saikat_> kushal, yes.
[14:13] <abhinavshirur> ashwanig, press escape first
[14:13] <soumam_>  vipulgupta2048_ yes of course after i will learn python.I will do everything by script :)
[14:13] <kushal> ashwanig, Ah, you should be in the command mode.
[14:13] <abhinavshirur> you need to go in the command mode
[14:13] <kushal> Please stop talking about the other random things.
[14:13] <ashwanig> kushal, Sorry, my bad.
[14:13] <abhinavshirur> kushal :P
[14:13] <kushal> abhinavshirur, Good catch.
[14:13] <kushal> next
[14:13] <vipulgupta2048_> How to remove a PPA (repository) completely ? I have read the answers on forum but after doing ppa-purge, sources.list still shows the repositories.
[14:13] <ahole[m]> kushal: sorry my bad.
[14:14] <apoorv> !
[14:14] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: do you mean remove all PPA repo you have added?
[14:15] <kushal> vipulgupta2048_, sorry, I don't know about Ubuntu that well, can anyone else reply?
[14:15] <kushal> next
[14:15] <saikat_> praveenkumar, kushal , here is the pastebin: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/Ktm6fxENOC7xXofrqOul-Q
[14:15] <anupamas> i am not able to use "J" and K" keys nor up and down arrows :(
[14:15] <kushal> anupamas, are you in the command mode?
[14:15] <jasonbraganza> anupamas hit escape
[14:15] <pavan> Sorry to late because final year result , which topic going on ?
[14:15] <rkased> roll call: Razy Kased
[14:16] <dhairyya> editor pavan
[14:16] <anupamas> i am able to use h and l but not j and k
[14:16] <ahole[m]> pavan: text editors mostly vi and vim
[14:16] <pavan> Dhairyya : thanks
[14:16] <anupamas> the same goes with the arrows :(
[14:16] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan, No, Why would I do that. For installing Visual Studio a PPA was installed. I uninstalled vscode but the PPA still was left in the system and showing in sources.list in apt
[14:16] <schubisu> anupamas, do you have more than one line in the file you edit?
[14:16] <soumam_> anupamas, may be because you are in the first line. j and k to shift lines
[14:17] <anupamas> yes schubisu
[14:17] <dhairyya> you need to have lines spread across the file, anupamas
[14:17] <samridhia> !
[14:17] <asraisingh> !
[14:17] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: it's possible, you would like to remove all the ppa. This is because it searches the PPA everytime when looking for packages
[14:17] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: afaik, PPA are same as repo in Fedora
[14:18] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: it's better maxking answers this, he uses Ubuntu
[14:18] <wrik003> difficult to simultaneously follow the discussion here and also read from the log file!
[14:18] <sayan> saikat_: are you not able to install vim?
[14:18] <saikat_> sayan, Yes
[14:18] <zetathon__> and also difficult to wait for ur turn
[14:18] <rkased> !
[14:18] <anupamas> 2 lines to be presise soumam_  schubisu dhairyya
[14:18] <zetathon__> meanwhile you can't do anything
[14:19] <kdas_> kushal's network is down
[14:19] <jasonbraganza> anupamas: do 3-4 more
[14:19] <bhavin192> zetathon__, it's your
[14:19] <saikat_> sayan, Last package not installing.
[14:19] <anupamas> precise*
[14:19] <sayan> saikat_: login as root and remember don't log out of root until and unless I tell you
[14:19] <zetathon__> like :u is for undo, then what does :r do?
[14:19] <sayan> saikat_: I will tell you the steps one by one, okay?
[14:19] <ahole[m]> saikat_: try man vim and see the first line.
[14:19] <saikat_> sayan, yes, thank you, i am logged in as root
[14:20] <samridhia> :r replaces and :u is for undo
[14:20] <vipulgupta2048_> Yes I know, In the software menu PPA installed by the users are shown separately. I just want to know the best way to remove them (one particularly), maxking
[14:20] <Cyber_freak> !
[14:20] <saikat_> sayan, first line says vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor
[14:20] <zetathon__> samridhia, No its not replace
[14:20] <singh123> !
[14:20] <zetathon__> its doing something else only
[14:20] <theparadoxer02_> !
[14:20] <ahole[m]> saikat_: you have vim with the alias vi.
[14:21] <kushal> zetathon__, try that
[14:21] <samridhia> :r is copy pasting the same stuff again
[14:21] <anupamas> okay got it
[14:21] <kushal> next
[14:21] <zetathon__> like :u is for undo, then what does :r do?
[14:21] <sayan> saikat_: check pm
[14:22] <saikat_> ahole[m], so do i need to upgrade it or what? when i try to open txt files, it opens with regular txt editors
[14:22] <zetathon__> I tried but, I dont know whats heppening
[14:22] <jasonbraganza> zetathon__ caps lock?
[14:22] <saikat_> sayan, what is pm?
[14:22] <zetathon__> kushal, there was one line I typed long before
[14:22] <wrik003> saikat_, personal message
[14:22] <kushal> zetathon__, that was out of turn.
[14:22] <zetathon__> but when I'm doing :r, that line is coming back?
[14:22] <im_mohsin> !
[14:23] <sayan> next
[14:23] <saikat_> wrik003, my bad, sorry
[14:23] <zetathon__> batul told me to ask
[14:23] <zetathon__> and I asked
[14:23] <kushal> zetathon__, try this https://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html
[14:23] <ahole[m]> saikat_:  No! As I have observed that some of the latest releases have vim per installed but you'll have to use
[14:23] <ahole[m]> Vi filename.extension
[14:23] <ahole[m]> to use vim.
[14:23] <apoorv> No doubt
[14:23] <kushal> next
[14:23] <kushal> zetathon__, sorry, I have network lag, huge network lag this side
[14:23] <zetathon__> Also, how to get autocopletion for python in vim?
[14:23] <samridhia> what's the difference between :e! and u they both do the same work ?
[14:23] <ashwanig> Till now my favorite has been the change case using ~ :D
[14:23] <sayan> kushal: I am taking the questions
[14:23] <zetathon__> autocompletion
[14:24] <sayan> zetathon__: can you tell your question again?
[14:24] <zetathon__> sayan, how to get autocompletion for python
[14:24] <kushal> sayan, go ahead then
[14:24] <zetathon__> in vim
[14:24] <kushal> zetathon__, we will see that later.
[14:24] <wrik003> kushal, the cheat sheet is helpful!
[14:24] <soumam_> anupamas, is j and k  working? its also not working for me! not even my up/down cursor! only lateral movement is there
[14:24] <sayan> zetathon__: for that you need to install seperate plugin, let's not do that now
[14:24] <iKshitij> zetathon__: you need to configure and install plugin!
[14:25] <ashwanig> wrik003, Which cheat sheet?
[14:25] <iKshitij> !
[14:25] <sayan> zetathon__: once you get acquainted with vim, then you can go ahead and install plugins
[14:25] <kushal> For the record http://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vim.html
[14:25] <sayan> samridhia: can you repeat you questions, I seem to be have lost in logs?
[14:25] <zetathon__> sayan, I've have worked lill bit on vim before
[14:25] <bhavin192> ashwanig, https://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html
[14:25] <zetathon__> but could never rectify this issue
[14:26] <sayan> zetathon__: well, in that case after the case we can talk about that
[14:26] <samridhia> What's the difference between :e! and u they both work in the same way?
[14:26] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:26] <zetathon__> sayan, which editor is best for python?
[14:26] <sayan> zetathon__: which ever suits you
[14:26] <zetathon__> I've tried lot
[14:26] <zetathon__> none of them suits me
[14:27] <zetathon__> nor sublime
[14:27] <zetathon__> nor IDLE
[14:27] <zetathon__> nor atom
[14:27] <zetathon__> I need autocompletion, and none of them supports completely
[14:27] <kushal> zetathon__, please stop
[14:27] <sayan> samridhia: both of :e & :u goes to a older state
[14:27] <ahole[m]> zetathon__: try geany
[14:27] <maxking> vipulgupta2048_: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ is the path where all.liats are
[14:27] <singh123> zetathon , please give chance to others to discuss
[14:28] <zetathon__> Thanks ahole[m] ;)
[14:28] <zetathon__> kushal, ok :p
[14:28] <kushal> zetathon__, next time you will be kicked out
[14:28] <maxking> *all lists are
[14:28] <sayan> samridhia: but there is a difference, :u does an undo
[14:28] <kushal> same goes to all others.
[14:28] <sayan> samridhia: where are with :e you go to an older state, that could be measured in time
[14:28] <zetathon__> kushal, this thing will not be repeated. Sorry for that.
[14:29] <sayan> samridhia: :e 5s will go 5 seconds before
[14:29] <samridhia> sayan: got it perfectly!
[14:29] <sayan> or was that :ea, wait I am confused now :(
[14:30] <samridhia> no it is :e! which takes back to the previous state without saving the new one
[14:30] <vivek_> :e refreshes
[14:30] <vivek_> or reload
[14:30] <messifc>  /msg NickServ identify 123123kksk
[14:30] <sayan> samridhia: what vivek_ said
[14:30] <kushal> messifc, Now change the password
[14:30] <sayan> next
[14:30] <messifc> oops
[14:30] <sayan> next
[14:30] <asraisingh> kushal, I'm not able to use :e. Whenever using :e getting this error with some line number. E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)           7,29          All
[14:30] <anupamas> soumam_, try increasing lines
[14:31] <kushal> asraisingh, Out of turn
[14:31] <Cyber_freak> Is there a auto indent feature in vim like sublime has ?
[14:31] <kushal> asraisingh, also save the file first.
[14:31] <asraisingh> kushal, ok
[14:31] <zetathon__> !
[14:31] <ihp> Cyber_freak: yes.
[14:32] <sayan> kushal: no, it's asraisingh turn
[14:32] <singh123> !
[14:32] <sayan> next
[14:32] <Cyber_freak> I read about it but couldn't  understand
[14:32] <rkased> I know we are talking about editor Vim today, however I had a question about the FHS document, in my /media, I didn't see any other devices except floppy, why is that?
[14:32] <kushal> sayan, ah, I suddenly saw the message
[14:32] <samridhia> asraisingh: :e not working for me too same comment
[14:32] <apoorv28goel> !
[14:33] <sayan> I am putting the channel on mute. A few things now
[14:33] <sayan> People should not ask out of turn
[14:34] <sayan> or else I will remove voice from that person.
[14:34] <sayan> Returning back to normal model
[14:35] <sayan> rkased: ping at the end of the class
[14:35] <sayan> next
[14:35] <zetathon__> asraisingh, samridhia use :e! and not :e
[14:35] <singh123> I want to go to the n-th line, there are 2 ways as you told in previous logs.
[14:35] <kvy> sayan i also think so
[14:35] <singh123> :n and nG
[14:35] <im_mohsin> kushal, what is Alt + a?
[14:35] <sayan> singh123: yes?
[14:35] <singh123> but nG does not work here
[14:36] <rkased> !
[14:37] <sayan> singh123: how did you try the nG command?
[14:37] <samridhia> zetathon__ according to me :e! and :e both have different work to do.
[14:37] <singh123> in command mode
[14:37] <sayan> singh123: did you use that with a :nG?
[14:38] <singh123> no
[14:38] <sayan> singh123: in command mode, to go to ling number 5 press 5G where n=5
[14:38] <ashwanig> !
[14:38] <sayan> that should work
[14:38] <sayan> next
[14:38] <im_mohsin>  kushal, what is Alt + a?
[14:38] <zetathon__> samridhia, what do you want to do? The thing that is in the log is about :e!, and I dont know what :e do
[14:38] <zetathon__> does
[14:39] <apoorv28goel> !
[14:39] <singh123> sayan it is saying ambigious use of user defined command
[14:39] <Raut> !
[14:39] <theparadoxer02_> isn't there any way to render the logs in a more efficient way rather than just text, so that the links,tags and other stuffs are visible
[14:39] <vivek_> sayan: it's just :n
[14:39] <samridhia> :e is to edit at current position as its working for me
[14:39] <vivek_> and G will take to the end of file
[14:39] <asraisingh> samridhia, zetathon__ , :e! working
[14:40] <sayan> theparadoxer02_: yes, but we will not work on it
[14:40] <zetathon__> asraisingh, samridhia :e is only used to re-edit if changes are made to the file outside of vim
[14:40] <sayan> im_mohsin: next time I am kicking you
[14:40] <ani> !
[14:40] <sayan> im_mohsin: you are asking question out of turn
[14:40] <sayan> next
[14:41] <theparadoxer02_> sayan, i did not got you
[14:41] <singh123> !
[14:41] <sayan> theparadoxer02_: you are asking of the dgplug logs right?
[14:41] <sayan> theparadoxer02_: it's possible but right now we just render the text file
[14:41] <sayan> next
[14:41] <iKshitij> pass ! My question is related to plugin, will ask that after today's session.
[14:41] <theparadoxer02_> sayan, yes
[14:41] <sayan> iKshitij: cool
[14:41] <sayan> next
[14:42] <vipulgupta2048_> I use nano as a editor , would that be an issue ?
[14:42] <asraisingh> !
[14:42] <im_mohsin> i was reading documentation and when batul said next i accidentally sent it. Sorry sayan
[14:45] <singh123> !
[14:45] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: yes, totally works
[14:45] <sayan> if you are primarily using nano as your text editor
[14:45] <sayan> next
[14:47] <sayan> next
[14:47] <sayan> next
[14:47] <apoorv28goel> s,i and a-all three make insert mode active?what is the distinction?
[14:48] <apoorv28goel> Sorry my internet is acting up
[14:48] <rkased> I'm using Ubuntu 16.04, the $ doesn't work when I try to launch vim with it. It only works just by typing vim, then enter. Why is that?
[14:48] <abhinavshirur> apoorv28goel, read the log, all 3 of them have different meanings
[14:49] <apoorv28goel> that ques was not answered in the log
[14:49] <ashwanig> abhinavshirur, Agree with apoorv28goel
[14:49] <sayan> apoorv28goel: the are different task/modes
[14:50] <apoorv28goel> can you a little more ?
[14:50] <sayan> apoorv28goel: did you try to google?
[14:50] <jasonbraganza> i inserts at the cursor. a appends. google what s does
[14:51] <apoorv28goel> nope sorry
[14:51] <apoorv28goel> <jasonbraganza> thank you
[14:52] <sayan> apoorv28goel: google, you will find them, there are minor differences, also search for o & O
[14:52] <sayan> next
[14:52] <ashwanig> When finding a word using vim, is there any way that the whole word gets highlighted?<eom>
[14:52] <apoorv28goel> okay
[14:52] <sayan> ashwanig: yes, you need to configure vim for that
[14:52] <sayan> ashwanig: vim has a configuration file called vimr
[14:52] <sayan> vimrc
[14:53] <anuGupta> s is just deleting the current position
[14:53] <rkased> My question, I didn't see my answer before you moved to the next questioner?
[14:53] <messifc>  !
[14:54] <im_mohsin> anuGupta, no with s you find and replace text. eg: :s/foo/bar/g. G will replace all instance of foo
[14:54] <jiteshpabla> I have to leave the class in between.
[14:54] <sayan> rkased: sorry
[14:54] <rkased> no worries
[14:55] <ashwanig> sayan, Where is it located?
[14:55] <anuGupta> Not getting you,im_mohsin
[14:55] <ashwanig> it == vimrc file
[14:55] <singh123> !
[14:55] <bhavin192> ashwanig, in your home directory
[14:55] <sayan> ashwanig: you need to create in the home dir, please google search
[14:55] <sayan> rkased: you don't need to type the $
[14:56] <rkased> sounds good
[14:56] <im_mohsin> anuGupta, check thiis link: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace
[14:56] <ashwanig> sayan, Ok got it :)
[14:56] <sayan> next
[14:56] <wrik003> !
[14:56] <Raut> sayan: What is the home work for today?
[14:56] <sayan> Raut: yes, I will tell at the last, it's related to vi itself
[14:56] <sayan> next
[14:56] <ani> sayan,  In using 'nG' command it gives error E464: Ambiguous use of user-defined command and  what to do?
[14:58] <ani> in ' n' command gives error E163: There is only one file to edit , why?
[14:58] <sayan> ani: hmm, are you typing nG or substituing n with a number?
[14:59] <sayan> like 5G, 6G etc
[14:59] <ani> n with number
[14:59] <ani> yes 5G
[15:00] <sayan> ani: I have no clue on this; ping me after the class we will discuss
[15:00] <dhairyya> sayan maybe there are not 5 lines in the file
[15:00] <ani> ok
[15:00] <dhairyya> I was getting the same error
[15:01] <sayan> dhairyya: oh, but that works, you just go to the last line
[15:01] <vivek_> can i?
[15:01] <sayan> vivek_: always, don't ask if you know answer
[15:01] <singh123> I am also getting the same error.
[15:01] <vivek_> in normal mode, simply 4G will take you to 4th line
[15:01] <anuGupta> im_mohsin,I tried but its giving error.
[15:01] <vivek_> but, if you press : before then you are in command mode
[15:01] <vivek_> if you are in that mode, then you don't need G
[15:02] <dhairyya> sayan I tried in the command mode
[15:02] <vivek_> just press :4
[15:02] <ani> it gives with any value having more line then i type in nG command
[15:02] <Raut> !
[15:02] <sayan> next
[15:02] <naveejka> I have to leave now, thanks for today's session.
[15:02] <sayan> naveejka: no issues, thank you
[15:03] <asraisingh> sayan, should I ask question?
[15:04] <Raut> sayan : I also need to leave, could you tell the home work? Sorry for asking out of turn.
[15:04] <sayan> Raut: can you check the logs later?
[15:04] <anuGupta> Oh it's working.thanks im_mohsin
[15:04] <sayan> it should be in the end
[15:04] <sayan> next
[15:04] <asraisingh> sayan, I have 2 questions. First one is, are some commands are different but with same function? and Second one is, Commands provided in this log https://dgplug.org/irclogs/kushal_vi_1stclass.log is enough or I have to cover maximum of the commands from cheatsheet (Link: https://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html)
[15:05] <Raut> sayan : OK. Thanks for the session.
[15:05] <skarpy> asraisingh: it depends on how flexible you want to be with vim :)
[15:05] <im_mohsin>  sure. try with :%s and simple :s anuGupta
[15:05] <im_mohsin> both are different
[15:05] <anuGupta> Yeah
[15:06] <ani> thanks im_mohsin, it works
[15:06] <im_mohsin> ani, welcome :)
[15:07] <sayan> asraisingh: you can achieve same things multiple ways
[15:07] <sayan> asraisingh: you need to start using the editor, it's difficult in the beginning but then eases down
[15:07] <dhairyya> I need to leave. Thanks for the session
[15:07] <soumam_> !
[15:08] <sayan> https://static1.squarespace.com/static/537a9021e4b0dc8ed531ddef/t/579d9923e4fcb5403766d2ef/1469946184827/
[15:08] <ani> !
[15:08] <asraisingh> sayan, thanks sayan
[15:08] <sayan> ^^ this explains
[15:08] <sayan> next
[15:08] <wrik003_> To copy a word we use <yw>, right? but say my cursor is not at the beginning of the word but somewhere at the middle, then it does not copy the word entirely (when I subsequently paste it) but from the position of the cursor till the end of the word.
[15:09] <messifc> sayan, my turn didnt come :(
[15:11] <sayan> wrik003_: nope
[15:11] <vivek_> wrik003_: yiw
[15:11] <wrik003_> vivek_, sorry, what is this acronym for?
[15:11] <vivek_> "i" is for the current word
[15:11] <vivek_> yiw is the command you need
[15:11] <vivek_> yank the current word
[15:11] <shivamA1> thank you so much for today's session, very helpful :)
[15:11] <wrik003_> sayan, i tried it multiple times
[15:11] <sayan> wrik003_: yw copies from current location
[15:11] <deepika> !
[15:12] <wrik003_> sayan, yes but i think in the logs it was different. i'll check again. <eof>
[15:12] <sayan> wrik003_: yiw does the full word
[15:12] <vivek_> wrik003_: what i said is the one you need
[15:12] <sayan> next
[15:12] <wrik003_> sayan, vivek_ thanks.
[15:12] <vivek_> wrik003_: there is also "yaw" go check that one
[15:12] <wrik003_> vivek_, ok
[15:12] <sayan> next
[15:12] <soumam_> sayan we are using a command line text editor because it doesnt uses mouse and saves our time or it has some other advantages too?<eof>
[15:13] <sayan> soumam_: it's faster that GUI
[15:13] <vipulgupta2048_> Sayan , Kushal. Thanks for session. But have to go, will read the logs.
[15:13] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: no issues :)
[15:13] <harshcrop> log link plz?
[15:13] <vivek_> soumam_: it saves time, moving around the file is lot easier
[15:13] <ashwanig> harshcrop, it's please not plz
[15:13] <sayan> harshcrop: what does plz mean? pizza?
[15:13] <singh123> !
[15:13] <apoorv28goel> sayan:  I need to go. Is there anything else in today's session ? and is there any homework for tomorrow ?
[15:13] <soumam_> sayan, faster in terms of executing codes?
[15:13] <rkased> !
[15:13] <sayan> soumam_: once you remove dependency from mouse you get to be faster
[15:14] <harshcrop> log link ?
[15:14] <sayan> because you don't need to move to navigate
[15:14] <skarpy> !
[15:14] <soumam_> oh!
[15:14] <sayan> soumam_: people that why use h,j,k,l to navigate in vim
[15:14] <wrik003_> harshcrop, https://dgplug.org/irclogs/kushal_vi_1stclass.log
[15:14] <sayan> next
[15:14] <abhinavshirur> harshcrop, https://www.dgplug.org/irclogs/kushal_vi_1stclass.log
[15:14] <ani> in command of ':s' gives error E33: No previous substitute regular expression
[15:14] <harshcrop> Thank you
[15:14] <apoorv28goel> !
[15:15] <sayan> ani: you need to give the replacement args
[15:15] <vivek_> ani: you have to specify which one search and to replace with what
[15:15] <vivek_> and replace to what extent etc
[15:15] <ani> ok
[15:15] <soumam_> !
[15:15] <sayan> ani: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace
[15:15] <sayan> ani: you will see it as :s/foo/bar/g
[15:15] <anuGupta> The line numbers disappears after I open it again.
[15:15] <sayan> next
[15:15] <vivek_> :s/<the word to search>/<the word to replace with>/<some cute options>
[15:15] <deepika> i googled how to indent in vim,got satisfactory result for insert mode but while trying commands like <aB to unindent or >} seems nothing happening except the block getting highlighted ,could you suggest what i am missing ?<eof>
[15:16] <sayan> anuGupta: are you out of turn?
[15:16] <anuGupta> Sorry
[15:16] <sayan> deepika: to indent you can just use > and <
[15:16] <sayan> next
[15:17] <sayan> deepika: > indent, < for un-indent
[15:17] <singh123> sayad can it be live season as last years log?
[15:17] <sayan> singh123: the vim session?
[15:17] <deepika> okay,thanks !
[15:17] <singh123> yes
[15:18] <sayan> singh123: we can have that, but once you know the basics then it's better
[15:18] <wrik003_> sayan, yes please. difficult to do both simultaneously.
[15:18] <singh123> ok got it, thanks
[15:18] <sayan> wrik003_: both as in?
[15:18] <sayan> singh123: the thing once you know stuffs then we can do a over view class
[15:18] <wrik003_> sayan, back and forth - irc & log
[15:18] <sayan> on the things you need the most
[15:18] <sayan> wrik003_: ok
[15:19] <sayan> wrik003_: right
[15:19] <sayan> next
[15:19] <wrik003_> sayan, :)
[15:19] <rkased> How can I cancel my order in the queue question. I just figured out  the answer to my question.
[15:19] <sayan> rkased: I guess !! but I don't know if it happens now, the older bot used to do that
[15:19] <sayan> next
[15:19] <schubisu> sorry, I have to leave, see you all tomorrow ;)
[15:19] <skarpy> :set mouse=a , for navigating with mouse, if navigation using line numbers is complex, (reference- nG command)
[15:20] <sayan> see you
[15:20] <im_mohsin> !
[15:20] <rkased> !
[15:20] <sayan> skarpy: is that your question?
[15:20] <sayan> next
[15:20] <sayan> next
[15:20] <apoorv28goel> sayan:  I need to go. Is there anything else in today's session ? and is there any homework for tomorrow ?
[15:20] <soumam_> like as you said vimrc is a configuration file to change the highlighting,there was also something vimrc.tiny ! whatÂ´s config file is that for?i also saw gvimrc which i guess is the config file for the gui version.
[15:20] <sayan> apoorv28goel: see you
[15:20] <apoorv28goel> any homework?
[15:20] <skarpy> sayan: no, it's just something I want to share, becoz having problem was navigating, this ease it up
[15:21] <sayan> soumam_: I haven't heard about vimrc.tiny
[15:21] <sayan> For next class read: https://dgplug.org/irclogs/kushal_vi_2ndclass.log
[15:21] <sayan> next
[15:21] <im_mohsin> sayan, > and < by default uses 8 spaces. How to change that?
[15:21] <soumam_> ok no problem i think its updated so they have introduced something else,
[15:22] <vivek_> im_mohsin: it's probably tab
[15:22] <messifc> !
[15:22] <sayan> soumam_: I will look into it
[15:22] <vivek_> see: how to assign tab to spaces
[15:22] <vivek_> set tab=4
[15:22] <im_mohsin> vivek_, tab does not work command mode
[15:22] <samridhia> sorry have to leave! will read the logs later .
[15:23] <soumam_> Nice session got to go! Thanks, sayan :)
[15:23] <sayan> soumam_: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code
[15:23] <sayan> next
[15:23] <sayan> next
[15:23] <rkased> How do I open my newly saved .txt file when I just close out of vim and back at the terminal?
[15:23] <sayan> next
[15:23] <messifc> '>' and '<' dont work if i press them once, but when i press them twice. Is it what's supposed to happen?
[15:23] <sayan> rkased: vim <filename>
[15:24] <rkased> excellent
[15:24] <sayan> messifc: does it indent
[15:24] <sayan> ?
[15:24] <messifc> yeah.
[15:25] <sayan> messifc: oh right
[15:25] <messifc> but it moves the word. What if i want to write another word after giving indentation?
[15:25] <anuGupta> It is taking time to indent.
[15:25] <sayan> messifc: you must be indenting a single line
[15:25] <ashwanig> messifc, I was trying :> and :<
[15:25] <sayan> messifc: >> << is use to indent a single line
[15:25] <sayan> rather the current line
[15:26] <messifc> okay thanx  :)
[15:26] <bhavin192> messifc, it's thanks
[15:26] <sayan> messifc: it's thanks

[13:37] <jasonbraganza> so sorry! class on.
[13:37] <kushal> jasonbraganza, I can see people type here without reading.
[13:37] <jasonbraganza> Iâll behave
[13:37] <kushal> This gives a good idea about people.
[13:37] <ahole[m]> I guess everyone assumed it was the daily protocol.
[13:37] <sayan> The do read, ----- BEGIN CLASS ---
[13:37] <sayan> not Roll Class
[13:37] <jasonbraganza> was away for 10 seconds
[13:37] <sayan> s/Class/Call/
[13:37] <kushal> ahole[m], Yes, and the protocol says, wait till there is a roll call.
[13:38] <cran-cg> The countdown was a trigger though, it was fun
[13:38] <apoorv> It was a snow ball effect

[13:46] <skat_sd> Hi, can anyone help me:In vim, When I do :/ something to search and at another time, :/ *something* , both cases are not showing same search results. What is the difference? I did a google search anf it says the 2nd case does a search inside the lines. But, then what does the 1st case do?
[13:46] <sayan> here is mine: couple of plugins I use: https://da.gd/9iIa
[13:47] <sayan> skat_sd: when you search you just press /<search term>
[13:47] <skat_sd> sayan, not giving all results
[13:48] <kushal> skat_sd, show us an example.
[13:48] <sayan> skat_sd: so you have the space in there?
[13:48] <kushal> next
[13:48] <anuGupta> When I am searching for words it's highlited,even when I am reopening it it's still highlighted.How to get rid of this?<EOF>
[13:48] <skat_sd> sayan, yes.
[13:48] <kushal> anuGupta, I just search for a random text :p
[13:48] <vivek_> anuGupta: :nohl
[13:48] <skat_sd> kushal,  let me pastebin something for you.
[13:49] <sayan> anuGupta: :nohlsearch
[13:49] <kushal> okay.
[13:49] <kushal> sayan, Thanks.
[13:49] <kushal> I learned something :)
[13:49] <anuGupta> Oh thanks
[13:49] <sayan> skat_sd: you when you use *, it works as wildcard
[13:49] <kushal> next
[13:49] <imranjeetsingh_> there seems to be alot of command so only practice will help or there is some way to keep in mind?<eof>
[13:49] <sayan> skat_sd: so it matches anything before it
[13:49] <sayan> skat_sd: if I understood your question correctly
[13:49] <kushal> imranjeetsingh_, Yes, and practice means you will have to use the tools regularly.
[13:49] <kushal> For vim, you have to start using it for everything.
[13:50] <kushal> Write everything in vim only.
[13:50] <skat_sd> sayan, matches anything before it means?
[13:50] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: it all boils down to preferences, I will take a hands-on on how I use vim
[13:50] <imranjeetsingh_> ok
[13:50] <kushal> imranjeetsingh_, read http://norvig.com/21-days.html :)
[13:50] <kushal> next
[13:50] <sayan> skat_sd: do you know about wild-cards?
[13:51] <skat_sd> sayan, I saw a video by Eli the computer Guy on vim editor, there he said abt wild card
[13:51] <kushal> skarpy, abt?
[13:51] <kushal> oops
[13:51] <kushal> skat_sd, abt?
[13:51] <skat_sd> Though couldn't understand its difference with normal search
[13:51] <kushal> abta is All Bengal Teachers Association
[13:52] <kushal> skat_sd, Missing a letter?

[13:52] <ahole[m]> I was using fedora 25 on my system, yesterday I observed a strange thing that when I saw the first line of my man page of vi editor. It said "vi enhanced". So is it that all latest releases of all distros have vim per installed or vi is used as an alias in these newer releases ? Is vi deprecated or something?
[13:52] <kushal> ahole[m], in Fedora vi is an alias to vim
[13:52] <kushal> ahole[m], do this
[13:53] <kushal> $ which vi
[13:54] <kushal> next
[13:54] <rkased> YOu guys should try the vimtutor if you haven't it's helpful IMO.
[13:54] <kushal> How are people doing with touch typing?
[13:54] <rkased> Excellent
[13:55] <RIcharD_> Hard time :(
[13:55] <apoorv28goel> making progress
[13:55] <imranjeetsingh_> will take some time.
[13:55] <abhinavshirur> kushal: less struggle than before :P
[13:55] <niranjana> Moving/Crawling
[13:55] <harshcrop> not get much time on that because of gsoc
[13:55] <anuGupta> Practicing:)
[13:55] <singh123_> Doing on daily basis
[13:55] <deepika> Progress :)
[13:55] <priyansh> Enjoying :p
[13:55] <sayan> Good :)
[13:55] <pr97> doing daily
[13:55] <shivamA1> hard but enjoying
[13:55] <apoorv28goel> its difficult to press REturn key with oinky finger
[13:55] <ashwanig> kushal, Typing speed slowed down very much. But learning it.
[13:56] <jasonbraganza> kushal I hate gtypist now. my fingers hurt
[13:56] <im_mohsin> kushal, Touch Typing is taking tome for me. slow
[13:56] <wrik003> hey, sorry i'm late. had work at college.
[13:56] <akshayg96[m]> Practicing well
[13:56] <wrik003> Roll call: Wrik Bhadra
[13:56] <cran-cg>  I entered this on the console ``vi +12 python_gcd.py``. I was on the first character of the 12th line as it had to be. Then I typed J , went to the next line ( the 12th line was the for loop declaration and 13th was the line where I did some manipulation on a variable), the cursor pointed at a blank space, (space character I suppose) but then when I used + on the 12th line my cursor was on the alphabetic character. Why was it so ?
[13:56] <bhavin192> kushal, little struggle with Shift
[13:56] <jasonbraganza> kushal, but slow progress :)
[13:56] <cran-cg> <eof>
[13:56] <HoloIRCUser1> practicing daily! but still slow improvement
[13:56] <skarpy> kushal: some progress obviously.
[13:56] <cran-cg> And sorry for taking up time
[13:56] <neer> making progress
[13:56] <iKshitij> Positive :)
[13:56] <ahole[m]> Sometimes it get's a bit irritating when you just miss it by a character.
[13:56] <sitlanigaurav[m]> kushal: sometimes the words per minute are more sometimes less.<eom>
[13:56] <sayan> cran-cg: you were typing all this time?
[13:57] <cran-cg> Yes. I was framing the question
[13:57] <Skhk634> great.
[13:57] <kushal> Suggestion: do not worry about speed now.
[13:58] <iKshitij> It's easy to type common English word like 'then', 'when', 'there' :)
[13:58] <kushal> Just make sure that you can type without any errors, speed will come anyway.
[13:58] <iKshitij> kushal: I agree !
[13:58] <sayan> cran-cg: I am not very clear with your question, sounds like magic
[13:59] <sayan> cran-cg: I did not understand anything after "the cursor point at a blank space"
[13:59] <wrik003> !
[13:59] <sitlanigaurav[m]> kushal: its a work in progress.<eom>
[13:59] <avik> kushal, as to that I can't solve my typos! what to do?
[13:59] <kushal> avik, Means?
[13:59] <avik> a lot of errors!
[13:59] <vivek_> slow down
[14:00] <ahole[m]> !
[14:00] <deepika> !
[14:00] <sayan> avik: what errors? are you doing a lot of typing mistakes?
[14:00] <kushal> avik, work on that first, reduce the number of errors by typing slow.
[14:00] <avik> sayup
[14:00] <sayan> avik: if you are doing typing mistakes, then as vivek_ told slow down
[14:00] <kushal> next
[14:00] <avik> sayan, yup
[14:00] <wrik003> Did we do anything related to vim, the advanced part? (i missed out on the first 28 minutes) <eof>
[14:00] <iKshitij> avik: kushal told already, try to focus on less typing error. Type slow but correct
[14:00] <sayan> it will take time, I have the same issue, my brain is faster than my fingers
[14:01] <abhinavshirur> wrik003, you missed the link to sayan's configuration file
[14:01] <abhinavshirur> :P
[14:01] <avik> sayan, something like that happens
[14:01] <cran-cg> sayan: 12 th line starts with f and 13th Line starts with G. So when I press J on the 12th line my cursor is on the 13th line but pointing to a space, while when I use + on the 12th line my cursor points to G on the 13th line
[14:02] <wrik003> abhinavshirur, hah, i'll get on that later! did i miss anything important? rather, what were we discussing? <eof>
[14:02] <abhinavshirur> nothing else wrik003
[14:02] <skat_sd> !
[14:02] <sayan> cran-cg: I still trying to understand, ask in after the class
[14:02] <wrik003> abhinavshirur, ok, thanks!
[14:02] <sayan> cran-cg: I will you give some tools to replicate
[14:02] <kushal> next
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:03] <ahole[m]> Continuing my question.
[14:03] <deepika>  can we automate to load the previous vim sessions that we were working on ?<EOF>
[14:03] <ahole[m]> So vi is not there at all in the latest releases? Or is there any means by which you can install it?
[14:03] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[14:03] <cran-cg> Ok sayan thanks again :))
[14:03] <sayan> deepika: what do you mean by vim sessions?
[14:03] <Skhk634> kushal,sayan: Sorry I have to leave in the middle of class as i am travelling and internet is too slow.
[14:03] <kushal> ahole[m], I never tried.
[14:03] <sayan> deepika: do you mean start from the same place where you left last time?
[14:04] <ahole[m]> kushal: okay I'll do some googling!
[14:04] <vishami3> !
[14:04] <deepika> Yeah
[14:04] <sayan> deepika: yes, you can do that
[14:04] <SpEcHiDeR> Skhk634: switch to Matrix, and never loose an IRC conversation
[14:04] <deepika> Sayan^^

[14:04] <im_mohsin> !
[14:04] <sayan> deepika: you need to add it to the vimrc file
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <skat_sd> kushal, not missing any letter. I cant pastebin because I have to press enter after writing the command for searching in vim, but here is the thing: My document has a word  'Some' to the extreme left of 2nd line. when i do" :/ Some," it says pattern not found, when i do ":/ *Some* ", it shows up. Why so?
[14:05] <wrik003> !
[14:05] <bhavin192> skat_sd, don't add extra space /Some
[14:05] <sayan> skat_sd: yes, becuase the first one has a comma
[14:06] <sayan> and the second one as a wild card
[14:06] <sayan> also the space
[14:06] <skat_sd> sayan, ignore the comma
[14:06] <skat_sd> typo
[14:06] <sayan> skat_sd: then space?
[14:06] <sayan> is that there?
[14:06] <skat_sd> Yes
[14:06] <skat_sd> Ohh, no space to be put. Got it
[14:06] <kushal> next
[14:06] <skarpy> !
[14:06] <vishami3> does gvim work same as vim and why is it build? Can i use it..?
[14:07] <kushal> vishami3, ..?
[14:07] <sayan> skarpy: can you fpaste the file?
[14:07] <kushal> vishami3, you can use gvim
[14:07] <skarpy> Sorry sayan ?
[14:07] <sayan> next
[14:07] <im_mohsin> kushal, Can you explain 'cw'? I'm not able understand clearly.
[14:07] <kushal> It has a graphical interface.
[14:07] <sayan> skarpy: oops that was for skat_sd
[14:07] <kushal> im_mohsin, Change the current word.
[14:07] <kushal> next
[14:07] <wrik003> sayan, the other day, why did you advise against using matrix, riot or irc bouncers? <eof>
[14:07] <vishami3> okay kushal
[14:08] <im_mohsin> it not working for me. kushal
[14:08] <kushal> im_mohsin, wait
[14:08] <im_mohsin> ok
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: yes, because people rely on these applications, and then become ghost.
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: they don't come online
[14:08] <vivek_> ciw might work. cw will change starting from the cursor
[14:08] <wrik003> sayan, ok, i see.
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: they will never check the earlier logs
[14:08] <sayan> wrik003: it's always good to go slow
[14:09] <bhavin192> im_mohsin, it deletes the word and switches to insert mode
[14:09] <sayan> wrik003: matrix, riot, bouncers - I consider advanced, got it?
[14:09] <wrik003> sayan, yes.
[14:10] <kushal> im_mohsin, look at https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[14:10] <kushal> im_mohsin, tell me when you can see the terminal
[14:10] <sayan> im_mohsin: what is not happening? what happens when you do cw with cursor on a work?
[14:10] <sayan> s/work/word
[14:10] <sayan> next
[14:10] <skarpy> Suppose I have a particular word in my script that I want to replace with some other word, and this word is used in repetation, so all those similar words, how can I replace all at once?
[14:10] <sayan> skarpy: yes
[14:10] <skarpy> Using vim obviously
[14:10] <HoloIRCUser1> what is this ghost concept i am not getting it?
[14:11] <vivek_> skarpy: search and replace - google
[14:11] <im_mohsin> sayan, the cw actually deleting just the character
[14:11] <kushal> im_mohsin, Have you opened the URL I have given?
[14:11] <skarpy> vivek_: sorry? In vim?
[14:11] <meamitk> skarpy :%s/word/replace/g
[14:11] <im_mohsin> kushal, yes
[14:11] <sayan> skarpy: Larry and Sergey built tiny little website which contains everything. Try looking there
[14:11] <kushal> Can you see the terminal?
[14:11] <im_mohsin> yes
[14:11] <sayan> next
[14:12] <ashwanig> kushal, Is this the live terminal view that was to be introduced this year?
[14:12] <rkased> !
[14:12] <sayan> next
[14:12] <kushal> im_mohsin, can you see how cw changed the whole word?
[14:12] <rkased> Do you recommend using vimtutor? I think it is useful
[14:12] <kushal> next
[14:12] <skarpy> meamitk: 'word' is my original and 'replace' is my new word, right?
[14:12] <kushal> rkased, use anything you like.
[14:12] <rkased> ok
[14:12] <sayan> rkased: yes, people can use vimtutor, but again preferences
[14:12] <meamitk> skarpy yes
[14:13] <kushal> ashwanig, nope, we introduced it last year.
[14:13] <sayan> not everyone can learn from the same thing
[14:13] <skarpy> meamitk: ok thanks <eof>
[14:13] <sayan> rkased: I could not learn from vimtutor
[14:13] <sayan> next
[14:13] <im_mohsin> kushal, Yeah but for me its just deleting the character and going in insert mode
[14:13] <sayan> im_mohsin: are you in the end of the word?
[14:13] <vivek_> im_mohsin: are you at the last char?
[14:13] <iKshitij> skarpy: Check PM
[14:13] <im_mohsin> No
[14:13] <vivek_> im_mohsin: checkout: ciw and caw and cw - experiment
[14:14] <vivek_> and diw , daw and dw
[14:14] <im_mohsin> vivek_, ciw works
[14:15] <vivek_> all the 6 mentioned are for different features, checkout each of them
[14:15] <im_mohsin> kushal, sayan  why is this weird behavior with cw
[14:15] <kushal> No clue.
[14:15] <im_mohsin> Okay
[14:16] <yurii>   !
[14:16] <kushal> next

[14:37] <kushal> So you all know how I keep asking you about writing proper English, but there was no one to tell me that.

[14:40] <vivek_> vipulgupta2048: only that?
[14:40] <kushal> rkased, you missed the whole point.
[14:40] <ashwanig> kushal, Why didn't you edited that post later?
[14:40] <rkased> No I got it, lol.
[14:40] <rkased> Good example
[14:40] <vipulgupta2048> vivek_ reading it.
[14:40] <anupamas> sms language and unnecessary capital T in till which is in between the sentence.
[14:40] <jasonbraganza> ashwanig: these are his early posts. Just shows how far he has come!
[14:41] <ihp__> vipulgupta2048, It encourages you that you finally did something productive and helps to keep track your success.

[14:41] <anupamas> or missing full stop<eom>

[14:45] <rkased> As related to your suggestion of starting a blog about our experience related to this class, if I wanted to eventually build myself to make what I'm learning a career, what type of employment may I find myself in?
[14:45] <messifc> kushal, sure I will ask after session
[14:45] <kushal> rkased, depends on what you like to do?
[14:46] <kushal> rkased, I am using Fedora from core 1, that is around 2002-2003 days iirc.
[14:46] <kushal> rkased, Contributing to it from 2006.
[14:47] <kushal> rkased, For the last 3 years, it became my full time job, I get paid to have the same fun I used to have as a volunteer. This is one way to doing this as a career :)
[14:47] <rkased> Consultator or building interactive maps or applications for companies I supose
[14:47] <soumam007_> !
[14:47] <rkased> That sounds good kushal

[14:48] <wrik003> ahole[m], sure!
[14:48] <kushal> next
[14:48] <soumam007_> kushal, if we are using fedora in vm then understanding the operating system,will it be a bit different than the original one?
[14:49] <ahole[m]> now when you have no idea of what content you want to write you could try something like this.
[14:49] <kushal> ahole[m], Have to say, that does not look like a blog.
[14:49] <kushal> soumam007, Not much, but if you actually do good things, you will have to move a bare metal installation for daily usage.
[14:49] <kushal> next
[14:50] <vishami3> what theme do you use the most in vim .. & why..?
[14:50] <wrik003> ahole[m] is a motor bike fan!

[14:50] <poojaencoded> sorry for late due to net issue

[14:51] <soumam007_> kushal, i didnt understand 'bare metal imstallation'?
[14:51] <kushal> next
[14:51] <kushal> soumam007, Instead of a vm, directly install on the actual hardware
[14:51] <ahole[m]> skat_sd: http://kshithijiyer.tumblr.com/post/159970936289/the-masked-dj
[14:51] <kushal> soumam007, http://www.internap.com/2015/02/26/bare-metal-vs-hypervisor/

[14:52] <kushal> ahole[m], Now you are discussing other things.
[14:52] <vishami3> kushal : sorry i was supposed to write colorscheme !
[14:52] <soumam007_> yeah, i tried today! few problems are there ,i will sort it out soon
[14:52] <kushal> vishami3, I don't, I just use whatever it shows.
[14:52] <ahole[m]> kushal: Sorry got carried away!
[14:52] <kushal> next
[14:52] <kushal> People should try to write proper blog posts.
[14:53] <kushal> If you want to make random comments, twitter is a better place.

[13:51] <shivamA1_> Kushal i have used github pages to setup my blog shivamahirao.in
[13:51] <Phi> shivamA1_, your url seems broken.  Check it.
[13:52] <abhinavshirur> kushal, sorry, I will. I had named it after my gaming name.
[13:52] <kushal> shivamA1_, nice, now add it to the page
[13:52] <shivamA1_> Yes by mistake
[13:52] <shivamA1_> Ok kushal
[13:52] <kushal> abhinavshirur, You should also choose a better gaming name.
[13:52] <vipulgupta2048_> kushal my question ?
[13:52] <wrik003> Phi, shivamA1_ opens fine on my end.
[13:52] <kushal> vipulgupta2048_, that depends on themes, we can help you on that later.
[13:53] <vipulgupta2048_> Ok.
[13:53] <kushal> vipulgupta2048_, There are many here using wordpress, so you will get help :)
[13:53] <kushal> next
[13:53] <skat_sd> Why are we adding the feed page and not the direct url(homepage)?
[13:53] <kushal> skat_sd, good question.
[13:53] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS is the answer.
[13:54] <kushal> Basically it helps us to read your posts in an feed aggregators
[13:55] <kushal> For example, our formal planet is at http://planet.dgplug.org/
[13:55] <kushal> This is one place to visit where I can read all of the students' blogs
[13:55] <qwebirc166944> !
[13:55] <realslimshanky> !
[13:55] <kushal> next
[13:56] <qwebirc166944> what is the benefit to read in an feed aggregators ? you can read with direct url too
[13:56] <skat_sd> kushal, so the feeds act as a good overview when many blogs are there in a planet.
[13:56] <skat_sd> thanks
[13:57] <kushal> skat_sd, it helps to get the content of the blog.
[13:57] <kushal> qwebirc166944, yes, but then I will have to open each of your blog one by one.
[13:57] <poojaencoded> !
[13:57] <kushal> instead I can just open one site
[13:57] <kushal> next
[13:57] <rkased> !
[13:58] <poojaencoded> where i have to send my blog?
[13:58] <vipulgupta2048_> https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/studentplanet
[13:58] <wrik003> poojaencoded, https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/studentplanet
[13:58] <realslimshanky> DNS for my blog is still to be updated. Will it be a problem as I've already added the lonk. <eof>
[13:58] <realslimshanky> *link
[13:58] <kushal> realslimshanky, no problem
[13:58] <kushal> next
[13:58] <qwebirc166944> !
[13:58] <qwebirc166944> !
[13:58] <kushal> poojaencoded, you asked out of turn
[13:59] <kushal> :(
[13:59] <kushal> next
[13:59] <rkased> What type of content do you want to see us produce on these blogs?
[13:59] <kushal> rkased, anything you like to talk about to the world.
[13:59] <rkased> sounds good
[13:59] <kushal> rkased, But, of course more about your own development, things you learn.
[13:59] <poojaencoded> !
[13:59] <qwebirc166944> how to login with same username on webchat.freenode.net as i lost that after reconnecting?
[13:59] <rkased> yea for sure
[14:00] <kushal> rkased, this will help others to understand things about you, learn from you
[14:00] <kushal> qwebirc166944, learn about release command for nickserv
[14:00] <rkased> okay
[14:00] <theparadoxer02_> !
[14:01] <qwebirc166944> okay
[14:01] <kushal> next
[14:01] <kushal> next
[14:01] <ikshitij> qwebirc166944: Just like Facebook or Twitter feed, where you get posts or tweets of all your friends on one page and you don't have to visit everyone's profile one by one :)
[14:01] <poojaencoded> why there is added /feed? <eof>
[14:02] <kushal> poojaencoded, Have you read that rss link I gave?
[14:02] <Phi> poojaencoded, ^^
[14:02] <rkased> However, the RSS feed for an individual is what has been subscribed, not random.
[14:02] <kushal> next
[14:02] <theparadoxer02_> I have seen people sharing personal stuffs like , their last night nightmare etc on their blog is it okay to share such stuffs ?
[14:03] <theparadoxer02_> Since it is supposed to be tech blog.
[14:03] <poojaencoded> no,where is it?
[14:03] <vivek_> theparadoxer02_: kushal answered this last class
[14:03] <wrik003> poojaencoded, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS
[14:04] <messifc> theparadoxer02_: its your choice what you want to write in your blogs. Why tell people those type of stuffs?
[14:04] <kushal> theparadoxer02_, Again, personal choice

[14:08] <kushal> ikshitij, If you want to write about politics, then yes.
[14:08] <kushal> If you have different tags, categories, that will help you to separate using different feeds
[14:08] <qwebirc166944> how to know which type we have to use either feed or rss.xml?
[14:09] <soumam_> !
[14:09] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:09] <kushal> ikshitij, For example, https://kushaldas.in/categories/python.xml is only for Python related posts in my blog
[14:09] <qwebirc166944> how to know which type we have to use either feed or rss.xml?
[14:09] <kushal> qwebirc166944, depends on which software you are using

[14:31] <sakshi> <eof>
[14:31] <kushal> skat_sd, people don't work on big projects in etherpad

[13:35] <rkased_> It was verified that it was correct
[13:35] <kushal> rkased_, check the url I just now gave.
[13:35] <jasonbraganza> kushal: probably some wrong circumstances with rkased_ . we validated his feed. it was fine

[13:39] <kushal> Asking is okay.

[13:40] <devesh_V> !
[13:40] <kushal> next
[13:40] <ashwanig> I have been practicing on gtypist. Should I touch type everytime I type? Because when I have to type faster I can't touch type. Also I am having a tendency to forget which key is home position for which finger. So I am making errors everytime I start again after a break.<eof>
[13:41] <kushal> ashwanig, you will get it with time.
[13:41] <kushal> ashwanig, no worries, just keep doing touch typing whenever you are using computers.
[13:41] <niranjana> kushal , sorry, have modified my entry <eof>
[13:41] <kushal> next
[13:41] <devesh_V> Where can I correct my URL

[13:42] <kushal> devesh_V, correct it there.
[13:42] <devesh_V> Okay:)
[13:42] <kushal> cran-cg, / at the end

[13:43] <cran-cg> Thanks :)
[13:43] <kushal> Before we do anything new.
[13:43] <kushal> We started this training, and just into things.
[13:44] <kushal> But, we are yet to discuss why.
[13:44] <kushal> Why do we care?
[13:44] <kushal> Why should one learn these things?
[13:44] <kushal> What is upstream?
[13:44] <kushal> Why contribution matters?
[13:44] <Raut> !
[13:44] <kushal> We are going to have a session on these points, we will learn a bit about the history, and also why are we doing this.
[13:45] <kushal> next
[13:45] <asraisingh> ashwanig, there is some physical symbols on the keys J and F which helps to decide you j and k during touch typing
[13:45] <Raut> kushal:Actually, I corrected it, can you please check if it is right now?
[13:45] <kushal> Raut, yup, it is correct.
[13:45] <Raut> kushal : Thanks.

[13:49] <SandeepK> Rkased Who all here do not know about Markdown? If you don't know what is markdown, then type "me", otherwise do not type anything.
[13:49] <kushal> sudo dnf install or sudo apt-get install
[13:49] <kushal> The name is discount
[13:50] <kushal> Markdown is plain text format which can be converted into HTML in an easy way.
[13:50] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown is the wiki page.
[13:51] <ani> ME
[13:51] <kushal> Now, before reading the wikipedia page, read this blog post: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001189

[13:53] <soumam007> kushal, sudo apt-get install discount?
[13:53] <kushal> soumam007, try that.
[13:53] <wrik003> soumam007, yes
[13:54] <Kasedr> Aaron Schwartz

[13:55] <soumam007> is another process using it?
[13:55] <kushal> soumam007, Most probably yes.
[13:56] <soumam007> kushal,  i didnot understand its the error in the terminal written
[13:56] <kushal> https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/ this is a simple tutorial of Markdown format.

[14:00] <kushal> next
[14:01] <sitlanigaurav[m]> Can we use it to create web pages after converting to HTML ?<eom>
[14:01] <kushal> sitlanigaurav[m], HTML files are web pages.
[14:01] <Kasedr> Yea its smooth
[14:01] <cran-cg> sapahia: Yes

[14:28] <kushal> messifc, and you also stop typing plz.
[14:28] <bhavin192> samridhia, wow!, thanks you for flooding :(
[14:28] <ihp_> samridhia, Just open the link Kushal has sent.
[14:28] <kushal> samridhia, I just now gave you the link  paste.fedoraproject.org
[14:29] <samridhia> yes okay
[14:29] <kushal> samridhia, Open that, and then paste, and give us the URL
[14:29] <bhavin192> kvy_, which distro?
[14:29] <kushal> samridhia, In your case it already says that there is a discount-mkd2html command
[14:29] <skat_sd> ikshitij, mkd2html command not found
[14:29] <kushal> use that.
[14:29] <kushal> skat_sd, Which distribution?
[14:29] <kvy_> bhavin192 fedora 25
[14:29] <ikshitij> skat_sd: then you have to install discount packages :)
[14:30] <kushal> kvy_, discount-mkd2html is the command
[14:30] <skat_sd> kushal, got it, did not type discount before mkd2html
[14:30] <kushal> skat_sd, nope, if you are in fedora then that is the right command, for debian/ubuntu, it is different
[14:30] <kvy_> kushal ok i will try this too
[14:31] <kushal> next
[14:31] <kushal> next
[14:31] <kushal> next
[14:31] <im_mohsin> kushal, i got the gist of Markdown. Since i didint attend from beginning can i know what do we have to do now?
[14:31] <skat_sd> kushal, what is the complete command?
[14:31] <neer> I am using ubuntu 16.04, discount aint working but If i do mardown filename.md that works
[14:31] <soumam007> skat_sd, its varying from system to system i wrote discount it wasnt working but when i used only mkd2html helo.md it worked
[14:31] <kushal> im_mohsin, just read the channel
[14:31] <ahole[m]> Which would be the best possible text editor/IDE with auto complete and error highlighting for markdown? Because if we are writing books in markdown we might need something to help us writing way too much of markdown code. <eom>
[14:31] <kushal> neer, Okay
[14:31] <skat_sd> ikshitij, how do i see the converted file?
[14:31] <neer> markdown filename.md>filename.html<eof>
[14:32] <im_mohsin> For that i have to wait for log to uploaded
[14:32] <kushal> ahole[m], That means you want a good editor, as markdown is plain text, any editor can do. Which one you prefer?
[14:32] <rkased> !
[14:32] <kushal> ahole[m], I use vim, code, or pycharm, or focuswriter
[14:32] <kushal> Based on what I am writing.
[14:32] <kushal> next
[14:33] <jasonbraganza> ahole[m] - the syntax is pretty compact. you can easily hold it in your head - https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
[14:33] <kushal> next
[14:34] <im_mohsin> !
[14:34] <kushal> next
[14:34] <ikshitij> skat_sd: use *ls* command to see file in that directory ! it should be like this --> hello.md hello.html .
[14:34] <im_mohsin> kushal, Do i need to download any editor?
[14:35] <kushal> im_mohsin, for?
[14:35] <im_mohsin> MarkDown
[14:35] <asraisingh> im_mohsin, you  can use vim.
[14:35] <kushal> im_mohsin, We use vim here (mostly).
[14:36] <rkased> While reading more on Markdown, it is mentioned there is no clearly defined standard, which standard/version are we working on?
[14:36] <skat_sd> ikshitij, mkd2html command not working
[14:36] <jasonbraganza> The John Gruber / Aaron Schwartz original
[14:36] <kushal> rkased, depends on the tooling
[14:36] <rkased> Okay, thank you
[14:37] <rkased> okay, thank you
[14:37] <kushal> rkased, for now we are using what jasonbraganza said.
[14:37] <maxking> Although, there are some markdown editors that show you in realtime how the HTML would look like. Might be helpful sometimes.
[14:37] <im_mohsin> kushal, i have a doubt after reading wiki page. Markdown is mostly converted to HTML for building website?
[14:37] <kushal> im_mohsin, yes
[14:37] <soumam007> !
[14:38] <kushal> im_mohsin, or to write a book
[14:38] <kushal> next
[14:38] <soumam007> can we do everything in md what we can do in html?
[14:38] <im_mohsin> Why is it? I understand it is plaintext but that is a overload right?
[14:38] <kushal> soumam007, nope, you can still write complex HTML by hand.
[14:39] <ikshitij> skat_sd: " kushal> kvy_, discount-mkd2html is the command"
[14:39] <maxking> soumam007: no! There is a lot of things you cannot do, like adding classes to elements and stuff. But that is because mardkown is meant only to write.
[14:39] <skat_sd> ikshitij, solved, i was putting an extra space before the -
[14:39] <kushal> im_mohsin, What is an overload?
[14:39] <skat_sd> ikshitij, yes, used that command now, works, thanks
[14:40] <im_mohsin> kushal, Extra work
[14:40] <rkased> !
[14:40] <kushal> im_mohsin, understood, but which one?
[14:40] <kushal> im_mohsin, let me show you an example.
[14:40] <im_mohsin> Ok
[14:41] <kushal> im_mohsin, Look at this blog post
[14:41] <kushal> im_mohsin, view source
[14:41] <soumam007> kushal, maxking , ok so thats for casual purpose of writing docs
[14:41] <kushal> im_mohsin, and then tell me typing that or just typing https://kushaldas.in/posts/updates-on-my-python-community-work-16-17.md is easier?
[14:42] <kushal> soumam007, Not casual, for serious work too
[14:42] <maxking> soumam007: casual is not the term I would use, but essentially markdown is for "content" more than "styles"
[14:42] <soumam007> ok
[14:42] <maxking> Although, you can pretty easily style markdown and there are some really good looking blogs/websites based on markdown
[14:42] <kushal> im_mohsin, tell us?
[14:43] <soumam007> maxking, name some
[14:43] <im_mohsin> kushal, Typing that mean the blog where you have used markdown?
[14:43] <jasonbraganza> soumam007: https://janusworx.com :P
[14:43] <kushal> im_mohsin, typing the html by hand, or the markdown I actually wrote?
[14:43] <kushal> You said overload, but did not tell us which one is the overload.
[14:43] <im_mohsin> Obviously, markdown seem simpler
[14:43] <maxking> jasonbraganza: That looks really nice!
[14:44] <pr97> !
[14:44] <maxking> soumam007: Nothing on top of my head
[14:44] <kushal> soumam007, Ghost
[14:44] <kushal> soumam007, Hugo
[14:44] <kushal> soumam007, shonku
[14:44] <kushal> next
[14:44] <soumam007> seems there are many
[14:45] <kushal> soumam007, yes, many.
[14:45] <kushal> soumam007, wordpress.
[14:45] <rkased> Is there a way to check my place in queue within the dgplug questions line?
[14:45] <kushal> rkased, Nope, but that can be a good idea to implement
[14:45] <kushal> rkased, we will add that.
[14:45] <kushal> next
[14:45] <im_mohsin> kushal, So markdown is only for light weight task like writing blogs and things alike?
[14:45] <pr97> kushal, I installed discount, but here is the error https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/2uIGMCtqyzHO5-FPktGxGQ and I am using ubuntu 14.04
[14:45] <rkased> I would be interested on how you set  that up if possible. Thank you
[14:46] <kushal> im_mohsin, writing blog or books, or documents or emails are very heavy weight work.
[14:46] <im_mohsin> Oh Yeah :)
[14:46] <kushal> pr97, the command mkd2html
[14:46] <soumam007> rkased, got a practical idea of queue of data structures today :)
[14:46] <kushal> rkased, You will have to write some go code.
[14:47] <kushal> next
[14:47] <rkased> I'm down for that.
[14:47] <sayan> rkased: down for what?
[14:47] <pr97> kushal, after mkd2html command?
[14:47] <kushal> pr97, I will not tell you.
[14:47] <rkased> Writing go code.
[14:47] <rkased> :)
[14:47] <pr97> okay, thanks kushal
[14:47] <kushal> pr97, After 1 hour you are asking this.
[14:48] <although> https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining see this @pr97
[14:48] <ikshitij> kushal: :)
[14:48] <ahole[m]> This won't work now.
[14:49] <pr97> okay thanks although
[14:49] <im_mohsin> !
[14:50] <sayan> next
[14:50] <kushal> next
[14:50] <im_mohsin> kushal, what is mkd2html and discount? i'm a bit curious. can't wait for the log to come out :)
[14:50] <bhavin192> im_mohsin, just search about it.
[14:50] <kushal> im_mohsin, They are tools to make us (the trainers) frustrated.
[14:51] <CuriousLearner> kushal: +1
[14:52] <im_mohsin> hahaha :D
[14:52] <kushal> Our next session will be on Friday.
[14:52] <soumam007> im_mohsin discount is the parser to convert and mkd2html is the command
[14:52] <im_mohsin> soumam007, convert markdown to html?
[14:52] <soumam007> yes :)
[14:52] <although> yes mohisin :)
[14:53] <soumam007> CuriousLearner, what is +1? i often see it
[14:53] <vipulgupta2048> !
[14:53] <Raut> kushal : Ok
[14:53] <im_mohsin> soumam007, although thanks :)
[14:53] <kushal> next
[14:53] <cran-cg> CuriousLearner: Its a thumbs up
[14:53] <vipulgupta2048> So now on the idea would be to write your content using markdown and integrating it with the HTML code to boost productivity, right ?
[14:53] <soumam007> cran-cg, oh niceway
[14:54] <kushal> Tonight first learn about markdown, and then write a blog post explaining it.
[14:54] <soumam007> +1
[14:54] <soumam007> to you
[14:54] <asraisingh> kushal, +1
[14:54] <skat_sd> soumam007, see, you learn fast!
[14:54] <im_mohsin> kushal, Sure
[14:54] <kushal> Now, everyone stop doing +1 in the session.

[13:33] <sayan> ^^ for today
[13:33] <ashwanig> !
[13:33] <singh123> I have one general question.
[13:33] <sayan> singh123: you can ask
[13:33] <sayan> singh123: but use !
[13:34] <sayan> next
[13:34] <ashwanig> Why home directory of root user is optional?<eof>
[13:34] <devesh_V> roll call: Devesh Verma
[13:34] <vivek_> :o
[13:34] <singh123> Sayan, I have not good internet connection, so in between i got disconnectd.
[13:34] <vivek_> maybe root lives underground
[13:35] <sayan> ashwanig: afaik it's not optional
[13:35] <Pavan> hi sorry i am late , is it class started
[13:35] <vipulgupta2048_> Optional as in
[13:35] <sayan> ashwanig: I need to check but.. maybe I know wrong
[13:35] <Cyber_freak> yes pavan
[13:35] <ashwanig> kushal, It was mentioned in the FHS document.
[13:35] <im_mohsin> Pavan, yes
[13:35] <sayan> ashwanig: Ok, I will check now
[13:36] <Pavan> my i know todays topic ?
[13:36] <kushal> may be it will start without any home directory at / (which used to be the home directory of root
[13:36] <schubisu> my suggestion: as far as I know, a home folder is always optional. root is not a user you should work with permanently, and home is for your personal files, so root should not need that.
[13:36] <im_mohsin> Pavan, If you any questions from previous topics. Its time to ask now :)
[13:37] <Pavan> im_mohsin : thanks
[13:37] <ashwanig> sayan, check section 3.14. Is it an optional reading? That's why it is written optional?
[13:38] <messifc> rollcoll: Messi Fc
[13:38] <messifc> Sorry I am facing network issues as I am travelling

[13:38] <ikshitij> !
[13:38] <adas0496> !
[13:38] <sayan> schubisu: yes, /home/<foobar> is optional
[13:39] <sayan> you can place it anywhere, and afaik you query from $HOME but it can be empty also
[13:39] <Kas> !
[13:39] <sayan> as kushal told it starts from '/'

[13:41] <championshuttler> messifc : ni
[13:41] <championshuttler> no*
[13:41] <ashwanig> sayan, Search online also, but didn't find anything useful
[13:41] <ghishadow>  in old days of linux, / was home directory of root but now it has different folder
[13:41] <CHOCOS> how do i get started i started today only ?
[13:41] <sayan> ashwanig: I will look into it, and tell you
[13:41] <sayan> next
[13:42] <abhinavshirur> !
[13:42] <ikshitij> "chmodÂ is the command which changes the file mode bits." What does file mode mean here?
[13:42] <cignatious> roll call: sharon christa
[13:42] <Cyber_freak> <messifc> They are discussing Filesystem Hierarchy Standard(FHS)
[13:42] <ghishadow> real last line of this http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/the-root-directory.html
[13:43] <sayan> ikshitij: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod#Symbolic_modes
[13:43] <imranjeetsingh_> CHOCOS, https://www.dgplug.org/irclogs/2017/ read it.
[13:43] <im_mohsin> ikshitij, it means the mode in which user can a access a file like a read(r), write(w) or execute(x)
[13:43] <sayan> next
[13:44] <saptaks> CHOCOS: wait for your turn to ask a question. If you have any question, type "!" and then wait for your turn
[13:44] <adas0496> I was going through the logs and saw kushal mentioning that Fedora is preffered linux distro for these sessions.
[13:44] <adas0496> I am a full time Ubuntu user.
[13:44] <adas0496> Any particular reason for preffering fedora? <eom>
[13:44] <sayan> adas0496: no issues, you can go with Ubuntu
[13:44] <ikshitij> im_mohsin: Thank you ! :)
[13:44] <adas0496> okay
[13:45] <sayan> adas0496: most of us are Fedora users, so it would be difficult to answer Ubuntu related questions
[13:45] <sayan> next
[13:45] <Kas> I've downloaded via and Discount, I should be using von to create a Markdown file than use Discount to convert to HTML?
[13:45] <Kas> Vim*
[13:45] <sayan> Kas: out of scope for class now, you need to ask after class
[13:45] <adas0496> I understand. However linux related issues should be common accross distos.
[13:46] <sayan> next
[13:46] <kushal> Kas, yes.
[13:46] <adas0496> Problem may arise with package installations.
[13:46] <Kas> I thought we had open questions now
[13:46] <Kas> Thanks
[13:46] <abhinavshirur> If someone is solving a doubt on chat, and if that person is going out of track (misunderstanding our question) , is it ok to interrupt? If yes, how?
[13:46] <sayan> adas0496: not really, if it's common we will try to help
[13:46] <kushal> abhinavshirur, Just ask at that moment.
[13:46] <kushal> abhinavshirur, say that you did not understand.
[13:46] <adas0496> alright
[13:46] <abhinavshirur> ok :) <eof>
[13:47] <sayan> abhinavshirur: or like tell "let me rephrase the question for you"
[13:47] <sayan> next
[13:47] <sayan> No more questions for now.
[13:48] <sayan> So today I will be telling on I use vim, the practices I use
[13:48] <sayan> - how I use it for programming
[13:49] <sayan> - plugins I use
[13:49] <sayan> and how I use them
[13:49] <sayan> so before starting lets start with a example text file
[13:50] <bhavin192> sayan, or live terminal?
[13:50] <sayan> bhavin192: no, I will give out instructions and people will type
[13:51] <bhavin192> sayan, cool :)
[13:51] <abhinavshirur> the awaited session ;) :P

[13:54] <sayan> I would suggest people to maintain a seperate notebook, to note down stuffs
[13:55] <ravindra> done

[13:55] <kvy_> sayan ok
[13:55] <championshuttler> done
[13:55] <im_mohsin> okay
[13:55] <sayan> Moving forward
[13:56] <sayan> *- How I open the file? The syntax is vim <filename.txt>
[13:56] <sayan> when the file opens; the file opens in command mode
[13:56] <sayan> you press 'i' to go into insert mode
[13:57] <sayan> you press 'Esc' to come back to command mode
[13:57] <Prerna> Roll call : Prerna Pandey
[13:57] <niranjana_> Roll call: Niranjana deshpande
[13:57] <sayan> To write text, you go to the insert mode and then type text
[13:58] <sayan> *- Now, one trick that I use, mostly in shell scripts is to automatically open the file in insert mode
[13:58] <sayan> *- You do that by this command `vim +startinsert <filename>`.
[13:59] <sayan> *- So people try this: vim +startinsert foobar.txt
[13:59] <sayan> does that work?
[13:59] <championshuttler> !
[13:59] <saikat_> like a charm :-)
[13:59] <asraisingh> yes
[13:59] <niranjana_> yes
[13:59] <ashwanig> sayan, It works

[14:00] <kvy> yes
[14:00] <sitlanigaurav[m]> yes
[14:00] <ikshitij> Yeah :)
[14:00] <sayan> *- Now, next if you want to open the file with a certain file number you use the syntax
[14:00] <Kas> Yes
[14:00] <Anuja_> yes
[14:01] <sayan> *- vim +<line_number> <filename>
[14:01] <sayan> *- so try `vim +35 foobar.txt`
[14:01] <sayan> *- Check if that works?
[14:01] <saikat_> Yes!
[14:01] <ghishadow> works
[14:01] <singh123> yes
[14:01] <asraisingh> yes
[14:01] <sitlanigaurav[m]> yes
[14:01] <sakshi> yes
[14:01] <asraisingh> There are is the word
[14:01] <adas0496> yes
[14:01] <santoshShaw> Yes
[14:02] <sayan> awesome :)
[14:02] <schubisu> well, it has only 13 lines, but yes
[14:02] <niranjana_> yes
[14:02] <_RicharD_> Yes
[14:02] <ani> yes
[14:02] <ashwanig> Yes
[14:02] <championshuttler> how to exit from insert to come to command mode ?
[14:02] <asraisingh> esc
[14:02] <avik_> !
[14:02] <ikshitij> championshutler: press Esc
[14:02] <asraisingh> championshuttler, esc
[14:02] <saikat_> championshutler, press esc
[14:03] <championshuttler> it did not work in ubuntu 16.04
[14:03] <im_mohsin> !
[14:03] <sayan> schubisu: thanks for noticing
[14:03] <sayan> schubisu: I will tell the steps to fix that
[14:03] <im_mohsin> championshuttler, for me too.not working correctly
[14:03] <sayan> let me go ahead and take questions of people who already asked
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <codepoetn> why should we type +startinsert when pressing an i is seemingly easier job
[14:04] <championshuttler> im_mohsin then what to do to go for command mode?
[14:04] <sayan> codepoetn: as I told this could come useful in shell scripts, automating pressing of 'i'
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <ikshitij> championshutler: It should work.
[14:04] <avik_> why do we need +startinsert? i mean pressing just 'i' isn't simpler?
[14:05] <im_mohsin> esc championshuttler
[14:05] <avik_> never mind
[14:05] <ravindra> !
[14:05] <sayan> avik_: I just answered that
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <avik_> yup
[14:05] <im_mohsin> it is not going to correct line number, sayan
[14:05] <saikat_> !
[14:05] <avik_> actually kept the thing written. thanks <eof>
[14:05] <championshuttler> not working i have to close first terminal then i have to do same process again :(
[14:06] <sayan> im_mohsin: right! my mistake. as schubisu told
[14:06] <sayan> *- People please remove the file you have and use this instead
[14:06] <ashwanig> championshuttler, Have you pressed Ctrl + S?

[14:11] <sayan> *- :!pwd
[14:12] <asraisingh> !
[14:12] <sayan> *- :!cat foobar.txt

[14:16] <sayan> next
[14:16] <asraisingh> !
[14:16] <im_mohsin> Can i execute a program in vim? let say i have c program i want to execute as i go. So can i use :!make <programname>
[14:16] <sayan> next
[14:16] <ahole[m]> !
[14:16] <im_mohsin> same question
[14:16] <messifc> when running ":!cat foobar.txt" I get error ":catch without :try" <eom>
[14:16] <ashwanig> !
[14:16] <sayan> im_mohsin: same question as?
[14:17] <sayan> im_mohsin: but it should work.
[14:17] <ikshitij> im_mohsin: try :)
[14:17] <Cyber_freak> python works in vim :!python
[14:17] <im_mohsin> as ikshitij
[14:17] <ani> messifc, you miss some thing
[14:17] <sayan> messifc: no clue
[14:17] <bhavin192> Cyber_freak, all commands should work
[14:18] <sayan> I have seen the limitation to this command yet
[14:18] <Cyber_freak> yes works
[14:18] <sayan> I usually use this without going on of vim
[14:18] <sayan> so \o/
[14:18] <messifc> sayan: sorry my bad. Now it's working fine
[14:18] <sayan> Okay moving ahead
[14:21] <sayan> *- These are a few things that I use
[14:21] <sayan> *- moving ahead with configuration of vim
[14:22] <sayan> *- So you can create a file in your home directory as .vimrc
[14:22] <sayan> *- If you already have? ignore (you probably know about configs :-)
[14:23] <saikat_> !
[14:23] <Cyber_freak> !
[14:23] <sayan> People please do this in a different terminal. Basically you need to have to open terminals. one to edit .vimrc
[14:23] <sayan> another for foobar.txt
[14:24] <sayan> next
[14:24] <sayan> next
[14:24] <asraisingh> sayan, as 'cat' command is taking whole text in command is there is any command to take only some lines from file?
[14:24] <sayan> asraisingh: head & tail
[14:24] <sayan> next
[14:25] <ashwanig> When I typed :!dnf then it shows a list of commands followed  by 'shell returned 1'. What does this mean?<eof>
[14:25] <sayan> probably dnf returns 1?
[14:25] <sayan> next
[14:26] <ahole[m]> Question already answered.
[14:26] <saikat_> how to setup vimrc?
[14:26] <saikat_> Should i type vim .vimrc?
[14:26] <vivek_> saikat_: should work
[14:26] <sayan> saikat_: yes
[14:27] <sayan> btw, I told you to create the file .vimrc
[14:27] <Cyber_freak> question answered
[14:27] <deepika> !
[14:27] <sayan> next
[14:27] <sayan> next
[14:27] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:27] <sayan> *- Open the vimrc with vim
[14:27] <sayan> *- vim .vimrc
[14:27] <deepika> is their a way to recover edits to a quitted file?
[14:28] <saikat_> sayan, doing that opens .vimrc in vim with nothing written. If i do :wq, it means i am also creating the file, right?
[14:28] <bhavin192> saikat_, yes, you are creating new file.
[14:29] <avik_> !
[14:29] <championshuttler> !
[14:29] <bhavin192> saikat_, first type ! then ask.
[14:29] <saikat_> bhavin192, i was actually continuing my question
[14:30] <avik_> what is the file name? .vimrc seems the extension, however a file is opened in vim? HOW?
[14:30] <avik_> oops!
[14:30] <sayan> deepika: yes, there is something called *.swp files
[14:30] <bhavin192> saikat_, oh, ok then :)
[14:30] <sayan> deepika: but out of scope for this class now
[14:30] <sayan> deepika: you can asked after the session
[14:30] <sayan> next
[14:30] <deepika> okay ,will do ,thanks :)<eof>
[14:31] <avik_> sayan asked!
[14:31] <avik_> what is the file name? .vimrc seems the extension, however a file is opened in vim? HOW?
[14:32] <kushal> avik_, Go out, and shout from the balcony, "HOW? HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?"
[14:32] <avik_> yup!
[14:32] <bhavin192> avik_, Linux does not depend on extensions, .vimrc means file name with .vimrc name . makes the file hidden
[14:33] <avik_> got the caps on by mistake
[14:33] <im_mohsin> avik_, .vimrc is not the extension. It simply means hidden file
[14:33] <ashwanig> avik_, It is the filename
[14:33] <sayan> Thanks for all who answered
[14:33] <im_mohsin> sayan, anytime :)
[14:33] <saikat_> !
[14:33] <championshuttler> !
[14:33] <avik_> thanks! got it! like android!
[14:33] <kushal> avik_, no, iOS.
[14:34] <ikshitij> avik_: heard of dotfile ?
[14:34] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:34] <championshuttler> !
[14:34] <sayan> *- Disable Arrow keys in vim
[14:35] <bhavin192> avik_, it should be same on iOS too
[14:35] <sayan> *- Add this to you vimrc file: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ashwin/4730888/raw/0a5251a55cda93c1ab46869d4d83e23161a5807c/DisableArrowKeys.vim

[14:38] <im_mohsin> sayan, yes
[14:38] <asraisingh> sayan, yes
[14:38] <saikat_> Why are we disabling arrow keys? they are easier to navigate than with hjkl.
[14:38] <ahole[m]> done
[14:38] <im_mohsin> !
[14:38] <vivek_> saikat_: they are not

[14:39] <saikat_> sayan, ohh, okay.
[14:39] <sayan> next

[14:43] <ikshitij> Sorry :(
[14:43] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:43] <bhavin192> sayan, my favorite site xD
[14:44] <sayan> *- You probably want your code to be autoindented
[14:44] <sayan> *- so you add this to the file `set autoindent`
[14:45] <sayan> *- If you want to so line numbers, add:
[14:45] <sayan> *- `set copyindent`
[14:46] <sayan> *- While searching, if you want to ignore case, add:
[14:46] <sayan> *- `set ignorecase`
[14:46] <saikat_> !
[14:47] <sayan> Tell me when done
[14:47] <sayan> next

[14:47] <poojaencoded> Sayan:which arrows keys are disable?i didn't understand<eof>
[14:47] <sayan> next
[14:47] <saikat_> sayan, how do i move about in insert  mode? arrow keys disabled, hjkl prints alphabets.
[14:48] <Cyber_freak> Arrows keys still works after adding them to .vmrc
[14:48] <asraisingh> saikat_, use e,w b
[14:48] <abhinavshirur> Cyber_freak, you have to exit out of vim first and open again
[14:48] <skarpy> saikat_: dont work in insert mode
[14:48] <abhinavshirur> from the file that you are editing
[14:49] <skarpy> saikat_: press ESC then do, hjkl
[14:49] <ashwanig> Cyber_freak, Its .vimrc not .vmrc
[14:49] <sayan> poojaencoded: arrow keys in your keyboard, there is only one set
[14:49] <saikat_> skarpy, then how to add what sayan said?
[14:49] <Cyber_freak> sorry typo
[14:49] <ghishadow> abhinavshirur: or :source % works too
[14:50] <sayan> saikat_: if you want to move in insert mode, remove inoremap lines
[14:50] <saikat_> sayan, its a readonly file, will changes be added?
[14:50] <sayan> saikat_: basically inoremap are for disabling in insert mode.
[14:50] <sayan> saikat_: no
[14:50] <abhinavshirur> ghishadow, thanks :)
[14:50] <asraisingh> saikat_, oh sorry e,w,b is a normal mode command
[14:51] <saikat_> sayan, then how to add commands that you just said if changes cant be added?
[14:51] <sayan> saikat_: locate for the .vimrc.swp file, delete it
[14:53] <saikat_> sayan, yes, there was a swap file. deleted
[14:53] <ashwanig> !
[14:53] <sayan> saikat_: should work now
[14:53] <sayan> next
[14:53] <avik_> !
[14:53] <ashwanig> set copyindent does nothing<eof>
[14:54] <sayan> ashwanig: that is useful when you copy in vim
[14:54] <sayan> next
[14:54] <avik_> can I add comment lines in vimrc file?
[14:54] <avik_> part that will not be executed?
[14:54] <sayan> avik_: did you google avik_ by any chance?
[14:54] <sayan> s/avik_//
[14:55] <avik_> nope
[14:55] <sayan> avik_: why not?
[14:55] <deepika> done
[14:55] <kushal> avik_, It is not a program that can be executed.
[14:55] <avik_> kushal, then?
[14:56] <sayan> *- So, we added a couple of set statements, but why are we adding that?
[14:56] <sayan> *- when you enter vim, you can manually enter these commands in the command mode
[14:56] <poojaencoded> !
[14:57] <saikat_> !
[14:57] <sayan> *- But it's not always possible enter each and every set commands when you enter vim
[14:57] <avik_> ok! got that!
[14:57] <sayan> *- So, you write in vimrc, so that vim does it for you at startup
[14:58] <avik_> great! <eom> :D
[14:58] <sayan> *- There are other commands also, like setting the tab, whitespaces, etc
[14:59] <sayan> *- Moving ahead, let me tell you about plugins
[15:00] <sayan> *- vim has a package manager called Vundle
[15:00] <sayan> *- where you can specfiy the plugin name in the vimrc file
[15:03] <sayan> omg, why internet is so slow :-(
[15:03] <sayan> *- this is the package: https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
[15:05] <sayan> *- You can add packages like this Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive' in vimrc file to install vim-fugitive
[15:05] <Cyber_freak> same issues with internet , super slow
[15:05] <sayan> I restarted the router works for me now
[15:05] <sayan> sorry for the delay
[15:06] <im_mohsin> Should we clone the repo before adding in the .vimrc?
[15:06] <ghishadow> im_mohsin: read README.md
[15:07] <saikat_> sayan, now when i open foobar.txt, wherever there is the word 'some" it is highlighted.
[15:07] <sayan> im_mohsin: see the README
[15:07] <sayan> saikat_: you might have searched that, type :nohlsearch
[15:08] <sayan> kushal: can you paste the vim file of yours?
[15:09] <sayan> people open this ^^
[15:09] <sayan> You will see kushal has added a bunch of set commands
[15:10] <sayan> then you have a few autocommands, what does autocommands do?
[15:10] <sayan> It's a way for vim to tell that do this action when this event happens
[15:11] <sayan> so lets take an example: autocmd BufRead *.vala set efm=%f:%l.%c-%[%^:]%#:\ %t%[%^:]%#:\ %m
[15:11] <sayan> so autocmd is the command
[15:11] <sayan> BufRead is the event
[15:11] <sayan> *.vala is the filter, (only to apply to vala files)
[15:11] <sayan> last, set efm=%f:%l.%c-%[%^:]%#:\ %t%[%^:]%#:\ %m is the action to perform
[15:12] <sayan> kushal vimrc does use plugins as you see, it's a very minimalistic vimrc file
[15:13] <vivek_> *not
[15:13] <sayan> vivek_: why not?
[15:13] <vivek_> sayan: i can't see plugin
[15:13] <sayan> oh! sorry, yes, does not
[15:13] <sayan> vivek_: thanks
[15:13] <vivek_> :)
[15:13] <poojaencoded> did i miss anything?because i haven't got any message last from 12minutes due to my poor internet connection

[15:15] <im_mohsin> should
[15:15] <sitlanigaurav[m]> what is the use of that plugin?<eom>
[15:15] <poojaencoded> i got my answer
[15:15] <avik_> !
[15:15] <sayan> im_mohsin: yes, you can use that
[15:15] <sayan> sitlanigaurav[m]: which one?
[15:15] <sitlanigaurav[m]> vundle
[15:16] <sayan> sitlanigaurav[m]: it's a package manager for vim
[15:17] <bhavin192> sitlanigaurav[m], it made installation of powerline(plugin) one line
[15:18] <sayan> sitlanigaurav[m]: you can install, uninstall packages with ease
[15:18] <sayan> and also manage
[15:18] <sayan> next
[15:18] <avik_> "  is what I was asking for? comment lines?
[15:18] <sayan> avik_: yes
[15:19] <avik_> oh!
[15:19] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[15:19] <sayan> next
[15:19] <poojaencoded> !
[15:19] <sayan> next
[15:19] <sitlanigaurav[m]> Can you tell me some examples for the use of plugins?
[15:20] <sayan> sitlanigaurav[m]: you can go to the different plugins pages, and they usually have a gif in the README
[15:20] <poojaencoded> i don't know how to send messsage for pm?
[15:20] <sayan> poojaencoded: it's okay, ask after class. the class is almost to end
[15:20] <sitlanigaurav[m]> sayan: okay, got it.
[15:20] <poojaencoded> okay sayan
[15:20] <ashwanig> !
[15:21] <sayan> sitlanigaurav[m]: A few things, I use like Ctrl-P for quickly searching files in vim
[15:21] <rkased> !
[15:21] <sayan> like SublimeText Ctrl+P
[15:21] <Cyber_freak> internet is so slow haven't even downloaded vindel
[15:21] <pr97> poojaencoded,  type this -  /msg  <nickname>  your message
[15:21] <sayan> sitlanigaurav[m]: then some for syntax highlighting
[15:22] <sayan> sitlanigaurav[m]: I also use nerdtree for for a directory structure in vim
[15:22] <sayan> I can browse through the file quickly in vim itself
[15:22] <sayan> numbers.vim for relative vim numbering
[15:22] <sayan> so these are few examples
[15:22] <sayan> next
[15:22] <sayan> next
[15:22] <ashwanig> Why do you make vim incompatible with vi?<eof>
[15:22] <vivek_> sitlanigaurav[m]: you can convert vim to an IDE by using plugins
[15:23] <rkased> I have a more general question, how does Vundel and Inspire codes compare?
[15:23] <sitlanigaurav[m]> sayan: thank you :)
[15:24] <sayan> rkased: I don't know either Vundel or Inspire
[15:25] <rkased> I meant Vundle
[15:25] <rkased> , but no worries, I couldn't find much, but did come across a blog.
[15:25] <sayan> rkased: in that case I don't know about Inspire
[15:25] <avik_> sayan, yes, following ashwanig , isn't vim and vi synonymous in fedora?
[15:26] <sayan> ashwanig: check :!help nocompatible
[15:26] <sayan> next
[15:26] <sayan> Ending the class here
[15:26] <sayan> But A few things:
[15:26] <kvy> kumar vipin yadav
[15:27] <kvy> sayan what kind of thing
[15:27] <sayan> kvy: I was just going to type you, read before you start roll call
[15:27] <sayan> I did not start roll call yet
[15:28] <kvy>   sorry for that
[15:28] <sayan> You can base your vimrc on other people's vimrc
[15:28] <kvy> but it's too late
[15:28] <sayan> but read before you use the particular command
[15:29] <sayan> kvy: its just 9 PM
[15:29] <sayan> Also, installing plugins can make your vim slow, so again before installing check how it affects vim
[15:30] <sayan> I personally try a plugin for couple of days, if it slow's down my work. I remove it
[15:30] <sayan> That is where Vundle is readlly helpful
[15:30] <sayan> next
[15:30] <im_mohsin> If we delete the pluggin from vimrc. Will it get back uninstall the plugging?
[15:31] <sayan> im_mohsin: there is a command that you need to run after deleting it from vimrc
[15:32] <joyhimanshu> sayan: okey got it ^ ^ and thank you for this informative session
[15:32] <saikat_> sayan, is it a good idea to copy someone else's vimrc configuration without understanding what each command does, or should i add features gradually as i discover?
[15:32] <im_mohsin> sayan, This: vim +PluginUninstall +qall
[15:32] <sayan> saikat_: it will delete all I guess
[15:32] <sayan> oops im_mohsin that was for you ^^
[15:33] <im_mohsin> Okay
[15:33] <sayan> saikat_: you can copy, the set time to learn what things are there
[15:33] <sayan> saikat_: and then move ahead
[15:33] <sayan> saikat_: I based on kushal vimrc
[15:33] <asraisingh_> sayan, class ended or running i get disconnected for a minute.
[15:34] <sayan> People try out Vundle, install a few plugins, remove them, and see how things work for you
[15:34] <saikat_> sayan, okay, you said kushal's vimrc does not have plugins, while yours have many. will kushal's vimrc be a better sarting  point?
[15:34] <rkased> Sounds good sayan
[15:34] <sayan> saikat_: yes, then lookover mine and add what you need

[13:33] <__anshul__> okay
[13:33] <deepika> !
[13:33] <sayan> next
[13:33] <deepika> is their any way to recover a quit with discard changes file in vim like restore session from 2 hours prior /does *.swp files contain those files too in vim or does it just contain those files that we quitted ?
[13:33] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan,I tried implementing markdown in various platforms but it seems it is different in other places ( the syntax). Is it not standard ?
[13:34] <__anshul__> vim, has swapfiles, see if you've enabled it
[13:34] <vipulgupta2048_> Example would be wordpress, some elements didn't work
[13:34] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: there is no clear standard for Markdown, but the basic elements remain the same
[13:35] <sayan> deepika: you can recover as long as there is *.swp file
[13:35] <im_mohsin> vipulgupta2048_, I wrote a blog post using Markdown and it worked completely fine to me
[13:35] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan, So I can refer to the cheat-sheet for each one , I think that would be better
[13:35] <sayan> deepika: when you open a file it's opens a swp file, you can recover from it
[13:35] <vipulgupta2048_> im_moshin, did every element worked the way it should ?
[13:35] <sayan> whatever is in there
[13:36] <__anshul__> @deepika http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html

[13:47] <sayan> *- Tux wants to be photographer, who has just bought a new DSLR.
[13:48] <sayan> *- Tux plan to be the next travel photographer, who would take the best picture from the top of Mt. Everest
[13:49] <sayan> *- But Tux is a newbie, so Tux starts watching for YouTube tutorials for learning to post process the images.
[13:49] <sayan> *- Tux creates a directory named *working* to put all un-processed images. <<-- mind *working* is to be focused here
[13:50] <sayan> *- Then, fires up DarkTable to process the images.
[13:50] <sayan> *- Every time after a set of similar operations (like crop & rotate, shadows & highlights, etc), Tux creates a copy of the *working* directory and names it `snapshot-{n}`
[13:51] <sayan> *- After a couple of operations, Tux stands having "snapshot-1", "snapshot-2", "snapshot-3", .... , "snapshot-100" directories.
[13:52] <sayan> *- This directories is history of how Tux developed the image over time. At any point, Tux can go back to a given snapshot and build again on top of it.

[13:54] <championshuttler> no
[13:55] <sayan> *- It's been a month now, Tux have learned a lot on post-processing images.
[13:55] <sayan> *- Tux now mixes and matches multiple images file to create a snapshot directory.
[13:56] <sayan> *- One day, Tux while processing the images, goes into experimental mode.
[13:56] <sayan> *- and only after a while realized that the changes should be going into two
[13:57] <sayan> *- different snapshot directories (`snapshot-139` & `snapshot-140`).
[13:57] <sayan> *- Smart Tux quickly thought of an idea, creates a new staging directory.
[13:58] <sayan> *- A staging directory works as an intermediate between the working directory
[13:58] <sayan> *- and the snapshot directory.
[13:58] <devendrabhat> #attendance Devendra Bhat
[13:58] <sayan> *- So, Tux now works on working directory, and one Tux is happy with the changes
[13:59] <sayan> *- Tux moves all changed files into staging directory, and then creates a copy of the staging directory as new snapshot directory
[13:59] <sayan> Any question till here?

[14:00] <asraisingh> ?
[14:00] <balaji> !
[14:00] <avik_> nope
[14:00] <soumam007__> how many directories are existing distinctly?
[14:00] <soumam007__> 2 or 3?
[14:01] <saikat_> !
[14:01] <asraisingh> sayan, or staging directory is an hypothetical directory?
[14:01] <navneet> !
[14:02] <sayan> asraisingh: soumam007_: you working on the working directory, once done with changes move the changes to staging, and the finally create snapshot from staging
[14:02] <cignatious> 3 i guess
[14:02] <im_mohsin> sayan, power cut here. did i miss a lot. I'm getting any messages
[14:02] <sayan> asraisingh: 3 for now
[14:02] <asraisingh> sayan, got it
[14:02] <championshuttler> !
[14:02] <sayan> asraisingh: yes, hypothetical, should be more clear when we do hands-on next
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:03] <balaji> Is staging area overwrites the existing one or it will create a new one?
[14:03] <saikat_> Is this staging area basically like a clipboard/buffer area?
[14:03] <navneet> Does staging area occupy extra space or memory
[14:03] <soumam007__> ok
[14:04] <sayan> batul: new one, you move your changes in there
[14:04] <soumam007__> but why not from working to snapshot directly?
[14:04] <championshuttler> is snapshot final directory?
[14:05] <sayan> saikat_: an area before the final snapshot/or commit creation
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <championshuttler>  is snapshot final directory?
[14:06] <im_mohsin> soumam007__, There are times when you don't want to commit little changes to directly. Staging act as intermediary where you club all the small commits and then send it from as a one commit
[14:06] <sayan> championshuttler: yes, directory is a hypothetical VCS theory, you will understand more during hands-on

[14:15] <sayan> next
[14:15] <balaji> Is user name and email id should be same as our github user name and mail id?

[14:16] <saikat_> just the email in the triangle brackets?

[14:18] <poojaencoded> sayan: after git add helloworld.txt?
[14:18] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:18] <sayan> poojaencoded: - git commit -m "Snapshot 1"
[14:18] <poojaencoded> okay
[14:18] <sayan> poojaencoded: without the first hyphen
[14:18] <sayan> next
[14:18] <vipulgupta2048_> Why did we do, what we just did ?  Like to just sum up, if you were going to explain that,ignore
[14:19] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: yes, I will explain each and every step in detail
[14:19] <sayan> Moving ahead then
[14:19] <sayan>  
[14:19] <sayan>  
[14:19] <sayan> *- So, you create a project directory called foobar
[14:19] <ani_> !
[14:20] <sayan> *- After that you initialize git into it, when you do git init it creates a .git directory inside foobar
[14:20] <sayan> *- You can check using ls -l
[14:20] <__anshul> ls -al
[14:21] <sayan> *- This directory contains all the information by Git
[14:21] <__anshul> .git is hidden
[14:21] <tenida> __anshul: Error: "git" is not a valid command.
[14:21] <sayan> oops, yes I missed -a
[14:21] <sayan> the correct command is ls -al
[14:21] <ahole[m]> ls -la
[14:21] <sayan> thanks
[14:22] <vivek_> tenida: install git
[14:22] <tenida> vivek_: Error: "install" is not a valid command.
[14:22] <saikat_> there is some .git. Why can i not see the name?
[14:22] <vivek_> oh
[14:22] <bhavin192> vivek_, tenida is bot
[14:22] <vivek_> i understood
[14:22] <ikshitij> saikat_: that's dotfile
[14:23] <ani_> saikat type ls -al
[14:23] <vipulgupta2048_> ls
[14:23] <saikat_> ani, did ls-al
[14:23] <vipulgupta2048_> with space between ls -al
[14:23] <bhavin192> ls-al command not found
[14:23] <__anshul> the "-a" helps in shows hidden files
[14:24] <vishami3> tenida : you need to install git not type `install git`
[14:24] <tenida> vishami3: Error: ":" is not a valid command.
[14:24] <bhavin192> saikat_, it should be ls -al
[14:24] <saikat_> bhavin192, yes did ls -al in the console, typo here.
[14:24] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: bhavin192: __anshul: can you stop helping saikat_?
[14:24] <__anshul> okay
[14:24] <bhavin192> sayan, ok
[14:25] <vipulgupta2048_> ok
[14:25] <sayan> becase seems like saikat_ did raise hand before asking the question
[14:25] <sayan> s/did/did not/
[14:25] <saikat_> sayan, sorry
[14:25] <bhavin192> right
[14:26] <sayan> *- Next when you do, git add helloworld.txt, it sends the changes to the staging area
[14:26] <sayan> *- and finall git commit -m "Snapshot 1" is where you create the snapsot/commit
[14:26] <Vamsi3296> ls .git
[14:26] <Vamsi3296> im sorry.
[14:27] <bhavin192> Vamsi3296, instant messaging?
[14:27] <sayan> *- You specify the message with -m argument
[14:27] <sayan> bhavin192: yes, apologizing to instant messaging :)
[14:28] <Vamsi3296> No,This iterm is messing with me.
[14:28] <sayan> So, moving ahead
[14:28] <sayan> - vim helloworld.txt # Add "Snapshot 2" to the file
[14:29] <sayan> - git status
[14:29] <sayan> What do you see? Can some one write what does git status show?
[14:30] <__anshul> modified:   file.txt
[14:30] <saikat_> modified:   helloworld.txt

[14:30] <santoshShaw> 	modified:   helloworld.txt
[14:31] <anuGupta> nothing added to commit but untracked files present
[14:31] <Vamsi3296> and modified: helloworld.txt.
[14:31] <cran-cg> https://pastebin.com/VvxBYUDM
[14:31] <poojaencoded> modified:  hello.text
[14:31] <asraisingh> changes not staged for comit
[14:31] <sayan> Hmm
[14:31] <sayan> Okay
[14:31] <ikshitij> modified:  helloworld.txt
[14:32] <yurii>  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[14:32] <cignatious> !
[14:32] <sayan> So, you should be having an out like https://pastebin.com/VvxBYUDM
[14:32] <asraisingh> yes
[14:33] <joyhimanshu> yes
[14:33] <sayan> __anshul: poojaencoded: why are you having other filenames?
[14:33] <sayan> im_mohsin: untracked file?
[14:33] <sayan> next
[14:33] <sayan> next
[14:33] <__anshul> I named it different, no worries
[14:33] <cignatious> changes not staged for commit
[14:33] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:34] <cignatious> why is it so?
[14:34] <poojaencoded> i gave my file name hello.txt that's why
[14:34] <sayan> __anshul: It is worries for other people who are learning for the first time
[14:34] <__anshul> okay sayan I'll keep that in mind here onwards
[14:34] <sayan> the difference in output can confuse people
[14:34] <anuGupta> !
[14:35] <sayan> cignatious: You will understand that after the next step that I tell
[14:35] <poojaencoded> i created with vim hello.txt.sorry
[14:35] <sayan> cignatious: so, basically these changes are not yet in the staging area
[14:35] <im_mohsin> sayan, this: nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
[14:35] <anuGupta> It is giving list of untracked files and not like one in pastebin
[14:35] <cignatious> I did it again and now i am getting it as no changes added to commit
[14:36] <sayan> im_mohsin: you probably did not follow all the steps
[14:36] <cignatious> am I doing it right?
[14:36] <sayan> anuGupta: you missed a bunch of steps
[14:36] <im_mohsin> sayan, maybe because internet is not working properly
[14:36] <sayan> im_mohsin: anuGupta: ask someone in PM for the logs
[14:36] <avik_> !
[14:36] <im_mohsin> ok
[14:37] <sayan> cignatious: do you see the output as: https://pastebin.com/VvxBYUDM
[14:37] <sayan> next
[14:37] <Shruti9520> <im_moshin> You can use git add --all
[14:37] <cignatious> no
[14:37] <vipulgupta2048_> Under untracked files it shows this to ".helloworld.txt.swp". What is this file?
[14:37] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: you vim session is probably still open, we explained this in last class
[14:38] <sayan> cignatious: can you past the output in pastebin, on what do you see?
[14:38] <im_mohsin> Shruti9520, thanks :)
[14:38] <cignatious> ok
[14:38] <sayan> anuGupta: Also wait before you ask you question
[14:38] <vishami3> <vipulgupta2048_> You must have not saved it, i think
[14:38] <sayan> anuGupta: wait for your turn
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <santoshShaw> !
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <sayan> next
[14:39] <fhackdroid> cignatious, just a word of caution to copy from terminal you have to use ctrl+shift+c
[14:39] <santoshShaw> what does "-m" signifies in the git commit -m "hello" ? <eom>
[14:39] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan, will recheck.
[14:39] <sayan> santoshShaw: check the log, I explained
[14:39] <anuGupta> Ok sayan <EOF>
[14:40] <meamitk> santoshShaw It is commit message
[14:40] <ikshitij> those who are getting "untracked files", you should add a file first using "git add file.ext"
[14:40] <vishami3> <santoshShaw> message that'll explain the changes
[14:40] <cignatious> fhackdroid: i know
[14:41] <santoshShaw> vishami3: meamitk : sayan, thanks
[14:41] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:41] <sayan> - git diff
[14:41] <Shruti9520>  santoshShaw: after writing -m , you give any message to your commit. You can write anything within quotes
[14:42] <sayan> *- With this command you can check the diff, basically the changes you've done but not in stage
[14:42] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:42] <im_mohsin> !
[14:43] <sayan> *- ^^ this moves the changes to the staging area
[14:43] <saikat_> !
[14:43] <sayan> *- git status
[14:43] <soumam007__> ikshitij, though i am not getting so but why are they getting that message?
[14:44] <andodococo> soumam007__: What r u getting ?
[14:44] <sayan> *- Now you would see a different output, as these files are added staging area before the commit
[14:44] <soumam007__> andodococo, "changes not staged for commit"
[14:45] <soumam007__> and no message
[14:45] <soumam007__> language please
[14:45] <bhavin192> andodococo, r? u?
[14:45] <vishami3> !
[14:46] <ani_> !
[14:46] <sayan> next
[14:46] <im_mohsin> sayan, git diff compare changes in the working directory and staging area?
[14:46] <sayan> im_mohsin: yes
[14:46] <sayan> next
[14:46] <saikat_> What is the meaning of the symbols  - and + and a &b in "--- a/helloworld.txt
[14:46] <saikat_> +++ b/helloworld.txt
[14:46] <saikat_> " after doing git diff?
[14:46] <saikat_> <EOM>
[14:47] <__anshul> saikat that means you added some stuff to the said file
[14:47] <sayan> saikat_: - means removed, + means added = this is in code portion
[14:48] <__anshul> !
[14:48] <saikat_> sayan, and the a & B act as bullet points?
[14:48] <sayan> saikat_: and --- a/helloworld.txt +++ b/helloworld.txt  means you are comparing a/helloworld.txt with b/helloworld.txt
[14:48] <sayan> next
[14:48] <vishami3> what does -u means ?
[14:49] <sayan> vishami3: update, moves all the changes from working to staging
[14:49] <sayan> vishami3: and you don't have to add file one by one
[14:49] <sayan> next
[14:49] <sayan> next
[14:49] <vishami3> okay
[14:50] <__anshul> as I answered some queries here, is that acceptable or should I just not interrupt?
[14:50] <cran-cg> !
[14:50] <balaji>  !
[14:50] <santoshShaw> vishami3: The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do. Link: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/11
[14:50] <sayan> __anshul: it's okay to answer
[14:51] <soumam007__> !
[14:51] <bhavin192> santoshShaw, it's totally different
[14:51] <vishami3> thanks <santoshShaw>
[14:51] <sayan> santoshShaw: no, we are not discussing git push now
[14:51] <sayan> next
[14:51] <sayan> next
[14:51] <cran-cg> sayan: Why aren't we doing git add . ?
[14:52] <sayan> cran-cg: that adds all the files which are untracked also
[14:52] <cran-cg> Plus isn't git push - u different from git add -u <eof>
[14:52] <soumam007__> "@@ -1 +1,3 @@" what does this mean?
[14:52] <sayan> cran-cg: yes, it is totally different
[14:52] <vipulgupta2048_> !
[14:53] <cran-cg> !
[14:53] <sayan> cran-cg: you want to carefully add the untracked files
[14:53] <cran-cg> And the -u flag is different for both the commands right ?
[14:53] <bhavin192> cran-cg, yes
[14:54] <cran-cg> Understood ! Thanks bhavin192 and sayan :))
[14:54] <vishami3> i think every sub-command has there own flags that's why *push -u* is different from *add -u*
[14:54] <sayan> soumam007__: tell you the numbers of lines added & removed and line numbers
[14:54] <sayan> vishami3: yes
[14:54] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:54] <sayan> - git diff --staged
[14:55] <vipulgupta2048_> My question,sayan ?
[14:55] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: yes, you will get your chance but we cannot take all the questions at once
[14:55] <sayan> then probably we never going to end the class
[14:56] <vipulgupta2048_> Ok no issues.
[14:56] <sayan> *- If you do git diff --staged, you see all the changes in the staging area
[14:56] <sayan> *- So it's good to check once before you make the final commit
[14:57] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 2"
[14:57] <sayan> *- You now create your next commit
[14:57] <sayan> - vim hellomars.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 3"
[14:57] <sayan> - git status
[14:58] <Prerna> nothing to commit
[14:58] <sayan> *- Now, you will see hellomars.txt in the untracked files, because the file is a git directory
[14:58] <ani_> !
[14:58] <sayan> *- But the changes of the file are not getting tracked by git yet
[14:59] <sayan> *- To add the file hellomars.txt for git to track what command show we use?
[14:59] <sayan> Think and answer
[14:59] <jasonbraganza> git add -u
[14:59] <asraisingh> git add
[14:59] <saikat_> git add <file>
[14:59] <cran-cg> git add -u
[14:59] <ikshitij> git add filename
[14:59] <avik_> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <championshutler> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <__anshul> soumam007__git add <filename>
[15:00] <vipulgupta2048_>  git add filename
[15:00] <joyhimanshu> git add  hellomars.txt
[15:00] <anuGupta> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <vishami3> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <__anshul> oops
[15:00] <cran-cg> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <sitlanigaurav[m]> git add -u
[15:00] <singh123> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <realslimshanky> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <ahole[m]> git add -u
[15:00] <santoshShaw> git add hellomars.txt
[15:00] <sayan> right! it's git add hellomars.txt, can somebody tell me why not git add -u?
[15:00] <realslimshanky> or git add . or git add *
[15:00] <balaji> git add hellomars.txt
[15:01] <__anshul> because "git add -u" is for files who are already staged once
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> sayan because you want be aware of what youâre adding?
[15:01] <realslimshanky> sayan, because it only checks the added file for updates
[15:01] <vishami3> *git add -u* will not look for changes in *untracked8 files
[15:01] <SpEcHiDeR> I think git add -u will add all untracked files.
[15:01] <vipulgupta2048_> Because git add -u will add all files to track in the folder. when dealing with more than one file.
[15:01] <bhavin192> because -u updates the files which are already tracked
[15:01] <avik_> sayan: we are adding, not updating
[15:01] <championshutler> that will add all untracked files i think
[15:02] <Vamsi3296> ls
[15:02] <sayan> Okay, here is why?
[15:02] <joyhimanshu> git add  -u  update all changes
[15:02] <samridhia> git add hellomars.txt
[15:02] <sayan> as the documentation says for `-u` = all tracked files in the entire working tree are updated
[15:02] <sayan> it's does not touch the untracked files
[15:03] <sayan> git add -u moves the diff of the tracked files to staging, and ignore all the untracked files you add
[15:03] <jasonbraganza> sayan understood
[15:03] <im_mohsin> so sayan for already existing file in staging area and now if we add a line to this file then we use git add -u? Correct?
[15:04] <sayan> So, you should explicitly use git add <filename> to tell git track the file from next time and directly move the changes to stage
[15:04] <sitlanigaurav[m]> sayan: got it
[15:04] <__anshul> im_mohsin correct
[15:04] <jasonbraganza> !
[15:04] <SpEcHiDeR> sayan: OK. :thumbs-up
[15:04] <sayan> im_mohsin: yes :)
[15:04] <sayan> next
[15:04] <sayan> next
[15:04] <im_mohsin> __anshul, thank you. I get confused with parameter
[15:05] <vipulgupta2048_> sayan,Doubt resolved
[15:05] <sayan> next
[15:05] <ani_> git add -u not working
[15:06] <sayan> realslimshanky: you should never use dot (.) or asterisk (*) until and unless you know what you are doing
[15:06] <sayan> ani_: context?
[15:06] <sayan> next
[15:06] <realslimshanky> sayan, got it :)
[15:06] <jasonbraganza> git add accepts wild cards? <eom>
[15:06] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yes
[15:06] <jasonbraganza> Thank you
[15:06] <vipulgupta2048_> !

[15:07] <__anshul> ani_ error message?
[15:07] <sayan> Yeah google :)
[15:07] <sayan> you probably will find a wiki page for it
[15:07] <sayan> - git add hellomars.txt
[15:07] <ani_> sorry it work
[15:07] <sayan> *- So add the hellomars.txt file
[15:07] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 3"
[15:08] <sayan> *- And then we commit
[15:08] <ani_> !
[15:08] <sayan> next
[15:08] <sayan> Any questions till here?
[15:09] <realslimshanky> No
[15:09] <Vamsi3296> nope.
[15:09] <im_mohsin> No
[15:09] <avik_> no
[15:09] <saikat_> !
[15:09] <ani_> it was producing error nothing to commit, working directory clean
[15:09] <sitlanigaurav[m]> no
[15:09] <vipulgupta2048_> Wild card is used for adding more than one files for git add
[15:09] <balaji> !
[15:10] <realslimshanky> vipulgupta2048_, yeah, like dot  ( . ) and asterisk ( * )
[15:10] <sayan> ani_: did you create the hellomars.txt file?
[15:10] <cran-cg> vipulgupta2048_: not exactly
[15:10] <meamitk> ani_ it is not an error
[15:10] <ani_> no
[15:10] <ani_> ok thanks
[15:10] <vipulgupta2048_> realslimshanky, will look that up, thanks.
[15:10] <sayan> realslimshanky: dot is not a wildcard
[15:10] <vipulgupta2048_> cran-cg, then ?
[15:11] <ashwanig> !
[15:11] <sayan> vipulgupta2048_: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/wildcard.htm
[15:11] <soumam007__> !
[15:11] <sayan> next
[15:11] <saikat_> What is this create mode number in "create mode 100644 hellomars.txt"?
[15:11] <sayan> saikat_: ah! nice question
[15:12] <sayan> There is actually a good answer in SO
[15:12] <realslimshanky> !
[15:12] <sayan> next
[15:12] <vishami3> <saikat_> i think it is similar to taking a snapshot for that commit file
[15:12] <balaji> Can we able edit the commit messeges?
[15:12] <ashwanig> Got the answer<eom>
[15:12] <sayan> saikat_: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/737673/how-to-read-the-mode-field-of-git-ls-trees-output/8347325#8347325
[15:12] <sayan> balaji: yes, you can. git commit --amend -m "New message"
[15:12] <sayan> next
[15:13] <sayan> next
[15:13] <soumam007__> why we will add (.) ?Is it that . .. you are talking about that are hidden and present in all directories?
[15:13] <sayan> soumam007__: no, this is completely different thing
[15:13] <balaji> sayan,  But how can we specify which commit messege we have to edit ?
[15:14] <soumam007__> ok please elaborate if possible
[15:14] <sayan> balaji: you cannot do that by specifying like a commit id
[15:14] <poojaencoded> !
[15:14] <sayan> balaji: but there is a way which is out of scope of this class
[15:15] <sayan> soumam007__: yes, when you do git add . it moves all the files from untracked & tracked to stage
[15:15] <sayan> next
[15:15] <balaji> sayan, Okay we will discuss after the class
[15:15] <sayan> next
[15:15] <realslimshanky> sayan, it's for adding hidden files ( which begin with . ) also along with others right? What is it called?
[15:15] <poojaencoded> sayan,not got "create mode 100644 hellomars.txt"?
[15:15] <soumam007__> ok and what for git add * ?
[15:15] <sayan> soumam007__: same
[15:15] <soumam007__> ok :)
[15:16] <poojaencoded> what is this and why is this?<eof>
[15:16] <sayan> poojaencoded: it's okay, if you don't get it now
[15:16] <realslimshanky> soumam007_, adding all the files except hidden ( starting with . ) files.
[15:16] <poojaencoded> okay
[15:16] <__anshul> poojaencoded you would have got this when you committed
[15:17] <cran-cg> soumam007__: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16969768/what-does-git-add-git-add-single-dot-command-do . Files present in currentdirectory and subdirectory
[15:17] <poojaencoded> _anshul:thanks
[15:17] <soumam007__> realslimshanky, cran-cg i will look into it thanks :)
[15:17] <sayan> soumam007__: right git add * does not add the hidden files
[15:17] <sayan> where as git add . does
[15:18] <soumam007__> ok there is the difference
[15:18] <sayan> but at the end of the day you should not use both
[15:18] <sayan> realslimshanky: I don't know if it is called anything
[15:18] <sayan> next
[15:18] <soumam007__> sayan, so that we can distinguish right?
[15:19] <realslimshanky> sayan, okay.
[15:19] <saikat_> !
[15:19] <sayan> soumam007__: no, you will mess up if you use that
[15:19] <sayan> soumam007__: you will end up changes that you don't want to add
[15:19] <soumam007__> oh
[15:19] <sayan> next
[15:19] <saikat_> sayan, SO says "1000000110110100 (100664): Regular non-executable group-writeable file."    Why is it not executable? I am executing it in git.
[15:20] <__anshul> soumam007__ then later you have to sit down and unstage unnecessary files
[15:20] <__anshul> for example the local files an IDE generates which are not needed in project repo
[15:20] <rkased> roll call: Razy Kased
[15:21] <sayan> saikat_: you are not executing it with Git
[15:21] <sayan> rkased: ? Why the roll call out of sudden?
[15:21] <soumam007__> __anshul, yeah thats an issue
[15:21] <rkased> I've been having login issues sorry
[15:21] <saikat_> sayan, ohh, i am just commiting a change, right?
[15:22] <sayan> saikat_: I will discuss this after class
[15:22] <__anshul> soumam007__, I am guessing sayan will you later about ignoring
[15:22] <saikat_> sayan, ok, thanks
[15:22] <Cyber_freak> Missed the class. Internet issues :-(
[15:22] <sayan> I am ending the class here.
[15:22] <im_mohsin> ok sayan :)
[15:22] <sayan> I would like to tell a few things
[15:23] <soumam007__> __anshul, didnot get you please rephrase if possible
[15:23] <soumam007__> :)
[15:23] <sayan> You cannot become a pro in the very first day
[15:23] <sayan> So, learn to ignore things
[15:23] <__anshul> in DMs may be <soumam007__> ;)
[15:23] <rkased> okay
[15:23] <vishami3> okay sayan
[15:23] <sayan> You don't need to learn each an everything on the very first day
[15:24] <sayan> Stick to the basics, you can build on top of basics
[15:24] <rkased> sayan, I always feel if I don't I need doing enough. However, your advice helps put things into perspective
[15:24] <Farhaan[m]> soumam007 anshul depends on your gitignore which sayan will tell you later
[15:25] <__anshul> <Farhaan[m]> , correct
[15:25] <sayan> and people those who know stuff, take care in mind there are people who don't know stuff and are learning
[15:25] <sayan> So, stop throwing random words, it's becomes difficult for those who are just trying to follow and learn
[15:26] <Farhaan[m]> sayan agreed
[15:27] <sayan> I did not know a lot of things like +++ a/... --- b/, then 100664, until I had been using git for 2-3 years
[15:27] <poojaencoded> sayan,you are right it is difficult for us
[15:27] <anuGupta> relatable ;)
[15:27] <sayan> And those you are new, try to be often on IRC and ask question. Just doing join in for the class
[15:27] <sayan> And devote more time than just reading logs
[15:28] <sayan> ask for books from people
[15:28] <im_mohsin> sayan, 100% true. I faced issues initially where i wanted to know every stuff the point i start but its a very bad learning habit
[15:29] <sayan> That's all what I want to say, from next time in class I would just tell you too stop if things would be tough for other people
[15:29] <sayan> and I want people to follow that
[15:29] <jasonbraganza> understood sayan
[15:29] <sayan> You can ask those questoins after the class
[15:29] <realslimshanky> sayan, nice :)
[15:29] <vishami3> sure
[15:29] <sayan> Telling this because things are going to be difficult in next class, so I want cooperation from all of you

[13:30] <sayan> *- *Chapter 3: Understanding VCS: Branches*
[13:30] <sayan> *- Few months more have passed. Tux visits a local workshop & presents one of his image.
[13:30] <soumam007> :)
[13:30] <sayan> *- Two clients love his image but one wants to add a Sepia tone to it and another want Black & White (B&W)
[13:30] <sayan> *- Tux now needs to change the work flow again, because over time Tux would be getting more and more clients.
[13:30] <sayan> *- Tux like Newton sat under a tree waiting for a apple to fall, but instead notices the branches of the trees which gave Tux an idea. A revolutionary one!
[13:31] <NikitaK3> Roll Call: Nikita Kotak
[13:31] <sayan> *- So Tux comes back home and starts working on the image. But now Tux creates two copies of images & names the directory as sepia & bw.
[13:31] <sayan> *- Tux who just happened to know linking, linked working directory to the sepia directory
[13:31] <sayan> *- So in the morning, Tux opens the working directory (which is pointing to sepia directory) opens the sepia directory
[13:32] <sayan> *- In the evening, Tux changes the link to bw, so Tux can work on bw image over the rest of the time.
[13:33] <sayan> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/vvEi9Satwai2FOprwAh0YQ
[13:33] <sayan> *- Next time, Tux get a new client, Tux just needs to create new branch directory & start working.

[13:43] <soumam007> ok
[13:43] <sayan> I told the answer just now
[13:44] <sayan> Moving ahead
[13:44] <balaji> If I shut down the system without commiting the changes Is the staging area will remain same when I restart?
[13:44] <saikat_> got it, yes. sayan
[13:44] <sayan> balaji: yes, it will be there because those are saved in a file
[13:44] <vivek_> balaji: the concept of "save" still remains same
[13:45] <balaji> Okay. got it. Thanks
[13:45] <sayan> and all the stuffs you do in git are saved
[13:45] <sayan> - git checkout -b sepia # Create a new branch -b=tells to create new branch

[13:46] <sayan> next
[13:47] <saikat_> *sepia
[13:47] <sayan> Right
[13:47] <ghishadow> git branches are just reference or lightweight movable pointer to a commit , so if there are no commit in repositary then are no branches
[13:48] <ahole> *sepia
[13:48] <ghishadow> there*
[13:48] <darkJedi> Suppose I make a wrongful change in my source code and I have to revert back to the previous commit. How should I do it?
[13:48] <asraisingh> avik, I had sent you today's log from the class start.
[13:48] <darkJedi> eof
[13:49] <hemanth> !
[13:49] <sayan> darkJedi: there are a bunch of ways to do it, git-revert, git-reset. but that's something I won't discuss in this class
[13:49] <sayan> next
[13:49] <cran-cg> !
[13:50] <hemanth> is branching created for versions
[13:50] <sayan> next

[13:51] <sayan> hemanth: no
[13:51] <cran-cg> after git add -u , i did git status, I get nothing added to commit
[13:51] <sayan> cran-cg: fpaste the output
[13:52] <sayan> hemanth: versions are very much on code level and not git but there are commands to manage the version well
[13:52] <messifc> sayan: sorry I have to leave urgently.
[13:52] <sayan> branches are to carry out parrallel development on the same working directory
[13:52] <asraisingh> !
[13:53] <hemanth> thanks sayan
[13:53] <anuGupta> Cran_cg : after git add -u ,you have to git commit -m "snapshot4"
[13:53] <cran-cg> sayan: https://pastebin.com/n8CvmWEG
[13:53] <sayan> like in Fedora, we maintain two branch master & develop. The development happens on develop and when we have to release we merge develop into master
[13:54] <sayan> and master is latest version and is deployed
[13:54] <bhavin192> cran-cg, you have not added the hellomars.txt to tracked files, we have done it in last session
[13:54] <sayan> cran-cg: you did not properly follow in last class
[13:54] <sayan> cran-cg: what do you thing you should do??
[13:55] <cran-cg> sayan: I made a new txt file.
[13:55] <cran-cg> Silly mistake
[13:55] <cran-cg> Understood
[13:55] <ashwanig> sayan, merging develop into master means replacing the old files in master with their new versions in develop right?
[13:55] <soumam007> cran-cg, share your mistake
[13:55] <ashwanig> Sorry I asked out of turn
[13:56] <deepika> !
[13:56] <sayan> ashwanig: the proper word would be updating
[13:56] <sayan> next
[13:56] <sayan> next
[13:56] <sayan> next
[13:56] <ahole> Now currently we are on the sepia branch, how do we jump back to the master branch?
[13:56] <deepika> if Tux wanted to create subbranch and navigste how would he do that ?
[13:57] <sayan> deepika: there is nothing as sub-branch
[13:57] <deepika> s / navigate
[13:57] <sayan> and I don't understand what do you mean with subbranch
[13:57] <im_mohsin> ahole, git checkout master
[13:57] <sayan> ahole: wait!
[13:57] <SpEcHiDeR> Gaurav: I can see the messages.
[13:57] <deepika> creating new branch like for b&w
[13:58] <cran-cg> soumam007: Umm. I was mistakenly made a new repo :(
[13:58] <cran-cg> Sorry for the confusion
[13:58] <cran-cg> :(
[13:58] <sayan> - git log
[13:58] <deepika> sayan and then change the branch from
[13:58] <avik> what is happening?
[13:58] <deepika> b&w to sepia
[13:58] <championshuttler> what is this going on?
[13:59] <sayan> People calm down
[13:59] <avik> why are people getting disconnected?
[13:59] <sayan> There is nothing to worry,
[13:59] <ashwanig> championshuttler, Matrix server is having problem
[13:59] <sayan> - git log
[13:59] <championshuttler> ashwanig, ok :)
[13:59] <sayan> Check the commits you have
[13:59] <sayan> You will be having the Snapshot 4 commit
[13:59] <sayan> - git checkout master # Simply move around branches
[13:59] <sayan> - vim helloworld.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 5"
[14:00] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:00] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 5"
[14:00] <sayan> - git log # Notice anything?
[14:01] <ahole> There is no changes in git still says snapshot 3.
[14:01] <im_mohsin> sayan, snapshot 5 after checking out to master?
[14:01] <abhinavshirur> it shows commits from the current branch?
[14:01] <ashwanig> sayan, Yes, Snapshot 5 commit got added
[14:02] <championshuttler> yes a new commit add to the list
[14:02] <jasonbraganza> sayan - not branch commits visible
[14:02] <sayan> You will find that the Snapshot 4 is not there
[14:02] <sayan> That is because Snapshot 4 commit is in sepia branch
[14:02] <bhavin192> sayan, Snapshot 4 is not there
[14:02] <sayan> not in master
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:03] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:03] <sayan> - git checkout sepia
[14:03] <sayan> - vim hellomars.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 6"
[14:03] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:03] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 6"
[14:03] <sayan> - git log # Again, noticed anything?
[14:04] <ganeshnomula_> !
[14:04] <santoshShaw>  new commit, "Snapshot 6"
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <saikat_> !
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <jasonbraganza> sayan - Sanpshot 5 missing
[14:05] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yup, Snapshot 5 is missing
[14:05] <saikat_> sayan, i cannot write anything in terminal after the git log. the cursor blinks on a word saying END
[14:05] <ashwanig> Yes
[14:05] <sayan> and Snapshot 6 is on top of Snapshot 4
[14:05] <im_mohsin> saikat_, do :q
[14:05] <sayan> saikat_: press q
[14:06] <sayan> - git checkout -b bw # What we are doing here?
[14:06] <ganeshnomula_> sayan: Is it If weâre in sepia branch and try git log, then it shows all the master and branch commits?
[14:06] <abhinavshirur> creating a new branch bw
[14:06] <saikat_> sayan,im_moshin, thanks, worked, but this did not happen the first time i did dit log
[14:06] <vipulgupta2048_> new branch , sayan
[14:06] <im_mohsin> creating a bw branch
[14:07] <deepika> got the new branch bw :)
[14:07] <im_mohsin> saikat_, happens everytime :)
[14:07] <ikshitij> creating new branch
[14:07] <sayan> ganeshnomula_: yes, because sepia is created of master
[14:07] <asraisingh> creating bw branch
[14:07] <ashwanig> creating a new branch and switching to that branch
[14:07] <sayan> so if you have a-b-c in master
[14:07] <sayan> and then you create a new branch out of master branch
[14:07] <sayan> you will have all the a-b-c commits
[14:07] <sayan>  
[14:08] <sayan> See, I told earlier that it's good that 2-3 people give the reply
[14:08] <sayan> But *nobody* listens
[14:08] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:08] <sayan> - vim hellomars.txt # Add the text "Snapshot 7"
[14:08] <sayan> - git add -u
[14:08] <sayan> - git commit -m "Snapshot 7"
[14:09] <sayan> - git log # What do you notice?
[14:09] <ganeshnomula_> !
[14:09] <sayan> next
[14:10] <ganeshnomula_> sayan: should Iâve to type in git checkout -b bw?
[14:10] <soumam007> getting a bit confused
[14:10] <imranjeetsingh_> snapshot 6,7
[14:10] <joyhimanshu_> snapshot 7 on the top
[14:10] <vipulgupta2048_> Snapshot 7 after Snapshot 6 with the log of master branch.
[14:10] <im_mohsin> ganeshnomula_, yes
[14:10] <jasonbraganza> no snapshots from sepia in here
[14:11] <cran-cg> sayan: History of last 4 commits including the ones done on sepia branch
[14:11] <yurii> switchwd to new branch
[14:11] <aryan1308> sayan: The snapshots of sepia branches are present in this branch
[14:11] <sayan> ganeshnomula_: yes
[14:12] <avik_> !
[14:13] <sayan> jasonbraganza: can you fpaste the output of git log --graph
[14:13] <cran-cg> !

[14:16] <ikshitij> avik: there's no snapshot 5 :)
[14:16] <sayan> avik_: in which branch did you do that Snapshot 5?
[14:17] <avik> haven't we done it?
[14:17] <saikat_> sayan, see mine once, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/hiF89k41HhnPhYVxDYiV3w
[14:18] <sayan> avik: I am really not getting you
[14:18] <avik> okay, I thought since we are moving sequentially, I thought we may have done it also! anyway, its okay! <eom>
[14:18] <ahole> https://pastebin.com/zmpkuuZV

[14:18] <avik> :(
[14:19] <cran-cg> My query answered. Thanks :)
[14:19] <sayan> No more need to paste the code and send the url here
[14:19] <sayan> next
[14:19] <im_mohsin> sayan, Had we created a branch from master we would nit have got commits from sepia right?
[14:19] <saikat_> !
[14:19] <sayan> im_mohsin: yes, right
[14:19] <sayan> next
[14:19] <soumam007> I cannot find the two text files when i open foobar and in master branch! why? but can see both when in sepia?
[14:19] <_anshul> now I get it
[14:19] <im_mohsin> thanks, this way my doubts gets cleared :)
[14:20] <sayan> * okay the next steps that I tell are only for soumam007 *
[14:20] <sayan> soumam007: can you do this?
[14:20] <soumam007> ok
[14:20] <sayan> - git checkout master
[14:20] <sayan> - git status

[14:21] <_anshul> only has the initial commits we made on master
[14:22] <cran-cg> _anshul: Let soumam007 and sayan speak
[14:22] <soumam007> for status its nothing to commit
[14:23] <soumam007> ls
[14:23] <Padfoot7> !
[14:23] <soumam007> only helloworld.txt
[14:24] <soumam007> sorry i havent worked with fpaste till now
[14:25] <sayan> soumam007: go to paste.fedoraproject.org and paste the output of the command
[14:25] <sayan> and paste the link here
[14:25] <sayan> I want all of you look and try to look what's wrong with soumam007's repo
[14:26] <sayan> Rest of you here is how the tree looks:
[14:26] <sayan> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sjKIB8WYg78Mhpe2jbb5EQ
[14:27] <im_mohsin> Yes sayan.
[14:27] <soumam007> sayan what i am copying from terminal isnt pasting in fedora paste
[14:27] <soumam007> sorry for such silly questions now
[14:28] <schubisu> sorry, I have to leave early. Thanks for the session, sayan
[14:28] <sayan> soumam007: did you open https://paste.fedoraproject.org/ ?
[14:28] <ashwanig> soumam007, Are you using Ctrl+Shift+C to copy from terminal?
[14:28] <soumam007> yes
[14:28] <soumam007> sayan ashwanig
[14:28] <sayan> soumam007: and paste in paste.fedoraproject.org with Shift + v?
[14:29] <sayan> lol
[14:29] <ashwanig> :P
[14:29] <sayan> Ctrl + v
[14:29] <soumam007> yeah did the same
[14:29] <sayan> soumam007: what's happening? you are not able to paste?
[14:30] <sayan> The text is not coming in the pastebin?
[14:30] <sayan> soumam007: if you are not able to do that leave
[14:30] <soumam007> ok, i got it
[14:30] <sayan> we will figure out later
[14:30] <soumam007>  i think
[14:30] <im_mohsin> do we have any command to check the tree structure in terminal?
[14:30] <_anshul> git log --graph
[14:31] <soumam007> terminal is in vm
[14:31] <soumam007> :( i am dumb
[14:31] <im_mohsin> thanks _anshul
[14:31] <sayan> im_mohsin: git log --graph --all
[14:31] <sayan> soumam007: I am moving ahead. come back to bw branch
[14:31] <soumam007> ok
[14:32] <sayan> next
[14:32] <sayan> next
[14:32] <sayan> next
[14:32] <casper01> Got my query answered. Thanks <eom>
[14:32] <sayan> next
[14:32] <imranjeetsingh_> why i am seeing commits of sepia in bw ?
[14:32] <balaji> whenever we create a new branch is that is created from the master branch or the current branch we are in?
[14:32] <jasonbraganza> balaji - branch youâre in
[14:33] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: because when you created a new branch bw, you were in sepia
[14:33] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: so you checked out a new branch bw out of sepia
[14:33] <im_mohsin> imranjeetsingh, because you were in sepia when you created bw and all commits in sepia were copied in bw :)
[14:33] <balaji> jasonbraganza, Thanks
[14:33] <imranjeetsingh_> ok thanks
[14:33] <sayan> imranjeetsingh_: so when you checkout a new branch you will have all the commits from the branch you are checking out
[14:33] <sayan> next
[14:34] <saikat_> my output is not matching with ahole. Will you see once at https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/hiF89k41HhnPhYVxDYiV3w ? i am getting snapshots 7,6,3,2 repeated 3 times.  ahole got snapshots 7,6,5,3,2,1 repeated twice. where is it going wrong? here is ahole's: https://pastebin.com/zmpkuuZV.
[14:34] <sayan> next
[14:34] <ganeshnomula_> My question is answered thanks :)
[14:34] <Padfoot7> can we import changes to "one particular file"  from another branch ?
[14:35] <im_mohsin> Padfoot7, yes you can do something like merge but thats a topic for other day i guess
[14:35] <sayan> Padfoot7: the question sounds ambiguous
[14:35] <sayan> saikat_: ahole did messup
[14:35] <sayan> :)
[14:36] <anuGupta> !
[14:36] <ganeshnomula_> imranjeetsingh_: check this tree link posted by sayan and perform git -log from different branches, youâll understand what youâre getting. https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sjKIB8WYg78Mhpe2jbb5EQ
[14:36] <sayan> The commit tree should be like this
[14:36] <im_mohsin> hahaha.. yeah.. saikat_ check sayan commits
[14:36] <sayan> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sjKIB8WYg78Mhpe2jbb5EQ
[14:36] <saikat_> sayan, ohh, is mine correct? i am getting the idea of branches, but still struggling with the implementation.
[14:36] <imranjeetsingh_> thanls ganeshnomula_
[14:37] <sayan> Just travese from the end I have written branch name in brackets and move back
[14:37] <sayan> tonext
[14:37] <sayan> next
[14:37] <sayan> next
[14:37] <anuGupta> I can see only last 4 commits when I do git log under any of the branches.Why is it?<EOF>
[14:38] <sayan> anuGupta: is those last four commits Snapshot 99, Snapshot 98, Snapshot 97 and Snapshot 96
[14:38] <sayan> ?
[14:38] <anuGupta> No
[14:39] <hemanth> i think git diff sepia and bw will help
[14:39] <sayan> anuGupta: you need to explain more.
[14:39] <anuGupta> Under log of bw I am getting snapshot 7 6 4 3 only
[14:39] <saikat_> !
[14:39] <sayan> anuGupta: so when you do git log you see the commits that your screen can adjust
[14:39] <sayan> anuGupta: and just press enter, and the log will scroll
[14:40] <sayan> next
[14:40] <bhavin192> anuGupta, down arrow
[14:40] <saikat_> sayan, very silly question, but i am not getting how to read and match your tree with the graph in my terminal. Help please
[14:40] <anuGupta> Oops sorry
[14:40] <sayan> saikat_: which graph?
[14:40] <saikat_> git log --graph --all
[14:41] <sayan> saikat_: ignore
[14:41] <saikat_> or just git log
[14:41] <sayan> saikat_: you don't have to
[14:41] <sayan> the one that in the link is the one I made manually
[14:41] <joyhimanshu_> !
[14:41] <sayan> next
[14:41] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:41] <joyhimanshu_> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/f4hc5ECL4rh8n-Ez8FBJ-A can u explain littlebit : sayan
[14:41] <sayan> *- *Chapter 4: Understanding VCS: Remotes*
[14:42] <sayan> *- It's been an year now, Tux owns a shop now.
[14:42] <sayan> *- So, Tux uses cloud services to backup the photos & publish photos.
[14:42] <sayan> *- Tux has setup some network endpoints, so that when Tux drops the photos into a particular endpoints it backup the photos in the particular cloud.
[14:42] <sayan> *- Tux's friend Nux is a computer programmer so who did the setup
[14:42] <sayan> *- The endpoints are origin: which points to Flickr
[14:42] <sayan> *- flickr: again points to Flickr
[14:42] <sayan> *- dropbox: points to Dropbox
[14:43] <sayan> *- 500px: points to 500px
[14:43] <sayan> *- When Tux runs: tux-shop push 500px sepia, it pushes the sepia photo directory to 500px
[14:43] <sayan> *- tux-shop push dropbox bw, it pushes the drop directory to dropbox
[14:43] <sayan> *- Tell me what would tux-shop push origin bw do?
[14:43] <im_mohsin> drop bw to irigin
[14:43] <im_mohsin> origin
[14:43] <jasonbraganza> push the master to flickr?
[14:44] <bhavin192> Push bw to Flickr
[14:44] <championshuttler> push to flickr
[14:44] <jasonbraganza> crap! sorry. not myself tonight
[14:44] <imranjeetsingh__> push to master
[14:44] <cran-cg> Flickr
[14:45] <santoshShaw> push to original repository
[14:45] <vishami3> push bw to origin
[14:45] <sayan> So origin is Flickr, and the branch is bw
[14:45] <skarpy> !
[14:45] <sayan> so it pushes the branch bw to Flickr
[14:45] <jasonbraganza> push bw to flickr
[14:46] <sayan> so basically remotes as the remote endpoint you want to interact with
[14:46] <sayan> next
[14:46] <skarpy> how origin is flickr? it can be dropbox.
[14:46] <sayan> skarpy: "*- The endpoints are origin: which points to Flickr "
[14:47] <skarpy> sayan: ok so it might point to somewhere else, you didnt define that before, ok got it :) <eom>
[14:47] <bhavin192> skarpy, he had defined it
[14:47] <sayan> skarpy: I had defined it
[14:47] <skarpy> so, if thre
[14:48] <skarpy> if there is push origin sepia, it goes to 500px?
[14:48] <saikat_> !
[14:48] <cran-cg> skarpy: [20:14] <@sayan> *- The endpoints are origin: which points to Flickr
[14:48] <im_mohsin> !
[14:48] <sayan> skarpy: no, it pushes sepia to 500px
[14:48] <sayan> let me discuss it more clearly
[14:48] <sayan> and then you can ask questions
[14:48] <skarpy> sayan: ok
[14:48] <bhavin192> skarpy, *- When Tux runs: tux-shop push 500px sepia, it pushes the sepia photo directory to 500px
[14:48] <realslimshanky>  /msg NickServ identify QWERTY.123
[14:48] <sayan> So, every remote has a name and a value
[14:49] <sayan> realslimshanky: we just say **********
[14:49] <bhavin192> realslimshanky, nice password xD
[14:49] <realslimshanky> Sorry! Now I'll have to change my password
[14:49] <skarpy> lol
[14:49] <skarpy> bhavin192, gotit, thank you! :)
[14:49] <championshuttler> lol
[14:49] <sayan> So, every remote has a name and a value
[14:49] <skarpy> s/gotit/ got it
[14:49] <sayan> value is the endpoint
[14:49] <sayan> and the name is with what you are referring to
[14:50] <sayan> so suppose in my laptop I do the setup
[14:50] <sayan> origin: pushes to Flickr
[14:50] <asraisingh_> its necessary to always push through end point?
[14:51] <sayan> flickr-remote: pushes to Flickr <here the name is flickr remote & endpoint is a Flickr URL (you will understand more during examples)>
[14:51] <rkased> Razy Kased
[14:51] <sayan> rkased: are you joining now?
[14:51] <rkased> No
[14:51] <rkased> Sorry
[14:51] <sayan> 500px-remote: pushes to 500px
[14:52] <sayan> rkased: then? Why do you write your name in between sessions everyday
[14:52] <rkased> Today was a mistake
[14:52] <rkased> I'm trying to follow your explanation of remote and endpoint
[14:52] <sayan> so in that case I need to do "tux-push flickr-remote bw" to push bw to Flickr
[14:53] <sayan> see you mention the name and then git would fetch the value and iteract with the URL
[14:53] <sayan> rkased: no issues :)
[14:53] <rkased> Excellent
[14:53] <sayan> Hope that makes things clear, a bit atleast
[14:53] <sayan> next
[14:54] <saikat_> is setting up origin important? can we not do   "tux-shop push flickr"?
[14:54] <jasonbraganza> saikat_ from which branch?
[14:54] <bhavin192> saikat_, then you will have to specify the URL every time
[14:55] <sayan> saikat_: you can just do tux-shop push, then it picks up origin & current branch
[14:55] <sayan> by default
[14:55] <saikat_> ohh, okay.
[14:55] <sayan> saikat_: or if you mention the remote name then the branch name is the current branch
[14:55] <sayan> I follow naming them all
[14:56] <bhavin192> sayan, he is asking that setting up is important or not
[14:56] <sayan> better to be explicit
[14:56] <saikat_> wait, i did not get your last line, please rephrase it?
[14:56] <sayan> saikat_: origin is there by default in git
[14:56] <sayan> saikat_: but you can remove it
[14:56] <jasonbraganza> saikat_ - allways spell things out clearly. then there is less scope for confusion
[14:57] <saikat_> jasonbraganza, what did i spell wrong?
[14:57] <sayan> at the end of the you need it just resolves names to values and then does the operation
[14:57] <jasonbraganza> saikat_ - i meant  specify things clearly
[14:57] <sayan> saikat_: :) don't worry. All is Well
[14:58] <saikat_> jasonbraganza, okay, yes.
[14:58] <sayan> saikat_: I meant you should write all the stuffs like branch name, remote name etc
[14:58] <sayan> next
[14:58] <im_mohsin> got answered when you explained now
[14:58] <bhavin192> !
[14:58] <sayan> next
[14:58] <bhavin192> If the origin is already there, then where will it point?
[14:59] <sayan> bhavin192: will tell after class
[14:59] <sayan> I don't want bombarded with questions :)
[14:59] <sayan> Folks, create GitHub account
[14:59] <skarpy> done
[15:00] <sayan> Then create a repo git-class-dgplug2017
[15:00] <asraisingh_> done

[15:21] <sayan> yurii: then you do git checkout master
[15:22] <sayan> yurii: then git push origin master
[15:22] <sayan> you can then read logs what happened in betwwen

[15:24] <sayan> im_mohsin: master
[15:24] <im_mohsin> yes
[15:25] <sayan> im_mohsin: git push --all will push all branches
[15:25] <bhavin192> balaji, you have to set the mail id with `git config`
[15:25] <sayan> balaji: because your git email & github email is not same
[15:25] <sayan> next
[15:25] <saikat_> i also got this after checkout: "Counting objects: 13, done.

[15:27] <bhavin192> hacker_, :O
[15:28] <skarpy> sayan: ok, i made a different repo, which will be useful to me later! :p
[15:28] <sayan> hacker_: the last commit you did in master in hellomars.txt was that of Snapshot 3
[15:29] <sayan> skarpy: sure, you are going to suffer later, can't help
[15:29] <sayan> skarpy: but it would be useful to you, so never mind
[15:29] <bhavin192> sayan, some people are too smart :)
[15:29] <skarpy> sayan: ok, sorry!
[15:29] <sayan> next
[15:29] <skarpy> bhavin192: :(
[15:29] <balaji> I  am not able to see the branches in github. Is I have to push that to. If yes How to do that?
[15:30] <sayan> balaji: you haven't pushed them
[15:30] <balaji> s/to/too
[15:30] <bhavin192> skarpy, I'm not saying anything to you, seriously :(
[15:30] <sayan> balaji: check the logs, I told to im_mohsin
[15:30] <skarpy> bhavin192: ok :p
[15:31] <im_mohsin> balaji, here git push --all, it pushes all the branches
[15:31] <sayan> - git remote add another-remote https://github.com/<username>/git-class-dgplug2017.git
[15:31] <balaji> sayan, Got it Thanks
[15:32] <sayan> next
[15:33] <yurii> sayan - i got this ----- fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/yuriypylypchuk/git-class-dgplug2017.git/'
[15:33] <im_mohsin> sayan, i have to go now. Thank you for this :)
[15:33] <championshuttler> yurii: you write wrong password
[15:33] <sayan> yurii: wrong password
[15:33] <sayan> im_mohsin: sure :)
[15:34] <adas0496> kushal
[15:34] <sayan> Now we added a new remote called another-remote
[15:34] <sayan> with the same url
[15:34] <yurii> how can I recieve a password if it looks like do not remember
[15:34] <sayan> It's like same number stored in your phone with two different names
[15:35] <championshuttler> yurii: you can reset it after going to github.com
[15:35] <sayan> yurii: https://github.com/password_reset
[15:35] <yurii> thank you
[15:35] <sayan> - git remote -v
[15:35] <sayan> should show both the remotes now
[15:36] <ashwanig> yes
[15:36] <hacker_> yes
[15:36] <sayan> adas0496: yes? a class is going on
[15:37] <adas0496> sayan, sorry that was by mistake
[15:37] <sayan> - git checkout sepia
[15:37] <sayan> - git push another-remote sepia
[15:38] <imranjeetsingh__> done
[15:38] <hacker_> done
[15:38] <sayan> So now you push via "another-remote"
[15:38] <sayan> In Github you would see two branches
[15:38] <sayan> sepia & master
[15:38] <hacker_> yes
[15:39] <sayan> Ending the class here
[15:39] <sayan> Any questions?
[15:39] <bhavin192> !
[15:39] <skarpy> !
[15:39] <asraisingh_> i hv some questions but will ask u later
[15:39] <ahole> How do you combine the master and other branches ?
[15:40] <sayan> next
[15:40] <bhavin192> Is it necessary to git checkout branch-name before pushing it?
[15:40] <balaji> !
[15:40] <sayan> bhavin192: no
[15:40] <sayan> next
[15:40] <ahole> sorry I spoke out of turn.
[15:40] <sayan> next
[15:40] <skarpy> so, if i have x number of remote, are those opening me to branches?
[15:41] <asraisingh_> sorry sayan.
[15:41] <sayan> what do mean by opening me to branches
[15:41] <sayan> asraisingh_: next is ban :)
[15:41] <asraisingh_> ok.
[15:41] <ahole> !
[15:41] <sayan> next
[15:41] <skarpy> i mean like, master is the main or source, and then we have branches, we can add branches to our repo, by adding remotes?
[15:42] <balaji> What will happen if we pushed those changes in same origin remote ?
[15:42] <ahole> How do you combine all the branches to form a new master branch ?
[15:42] <sayan> balaji: nothing the output will be same
[15:42] <sayan> as the remote si pointing to same URL
[15:42] <balaji> So  why we are adding another remote?
[15:42] <bhavin192> ahole, may be next class
[15:42] <sayan> skarpy: remote is way of communicating with the remote repo
[15:43] <sayan> ahole: git merge
[15:43] <sayan> Okay I see where people got consfused
[15:43] <sayan> I wanted to demo the name another-remote
[15:43] <sayan> we could have also done git push origin sepia
[15:44] <sayan> at the end of the day, git sees that it needed to push sepia to origin remote
[15:44] <sayan> skarpy: balaji got it?
[15:44] <sayan> next
[15:44] <skarpy> ok. so push origin sepia will do the same
[15:44] <avik_> !
[15:44] <sayan> next
[15:44] <skarpy> ok, got it
[15:45] <balaji> sayan, Got it
[15:45] <avik_> can we push to other clouds? like flickr or dropbox as yu said?
[15:45] <_anshul> yes
[15:45] <avik_> s/yu/you
[15:45] <skarpy> sayan: it will show under branch of github, i suppose<eom>
[15:46] <balaji> sayan, As like in example origin and Flickr pointing to same thing correct?
[15:46] <sayan> avik_: that was a fictional story
[15:46] <sayan> avik_: to explain
[15:46] <sayan> balaji: right
[15:46] <avik_> okay, so its only for VCSs?
[15:46] <anuGupta> !
[15:46] <sayan> there are some protocols if the serves on the receiving end is following that
[15:46] <hemanth> !
[15:46] <sayan> then you can push
[15:46] <sayan> next
[15:47] <sayan> next
[15:47] <hemanth> getting stuck at another-remote
[15:47] <anuGupta> Where in the github do I see the branches?
[15:47] <avik_> sayan: thanks. got it! <eom>
[15:47] <hemanth> can get a short explanation of what is it <eof>
[15:47] <sayan> anuGupta: Ctrl + F and then type Branch
[15:48] <_anshul> <anuGupta> https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>/branches
[15:48] <sayan> hemanth: what did you not understand
[15:48] <sayan> ?
[15:48] <sayan> another-remote is just another remote name

[13:49] <bhavin192> asraisingh, great :)
[13:49] <sayan> soumam007: yes
[13:49] <sayan> soumam007: why would it mot work?
[13:49] <soumam007> but it was created from sepia branch right sayan?
[13:50] <sayan> soumam007: so?
[13:50] <ashwanig> soumam007, Remotes are different from branches
[13:50] <ahole[m]> !

[13:52] <aryan> Roll call: aryan tripathi
[13:52] <soumam007> *created in different branches

[13:54] <adas0496> Abhishek Das
[13:54] <sayan> soumam007: it does not matter
[13:55] <sayan> soumam007: but there are few complications you will hit
[13:55] <sayan> soumam007: here is the thing, use, try stuff out
[13:55] <fhackdroid> sayan, ctrl+[
[13:55] <fhackdroid> and then vim bindings
[13:55] <soumam007> sayan, ok yeah trying ,created 4 repos today :)
[13:55] <ahole[m]> Is there any other open source vcs other than git?
[13:56] <sayan> soumam007: so here is the thing, as vivek and me told yesterday, we learnt git by doing crimes in git
[13:56] <sayan> next
[13:56] <sayan> fhackdroid: thanks
[13:56] <fhackdroid> sayan, :)
[13:57] <fhackdroid> sayan, I love the tux story for git :) brilliant way of conveying concepts
[13:58] <_anshul> indeed
[13:58] <sayan> Now I will set the channel to mute
[13:58] <sayan> *- When you contribute to a project, you have the main repository where you don't have the access. So you cannot push to the main repository
[13:58] <sayan> *- So, how do you contribute?
[13:59] <sayan> *- You fork the project, a copy of the main project is created in Github.
[14:00] <sayan> *- Then you pull the project from the Github to you local system.
[14:00] <sayan> *- You start working on the issue/feature/bug in a different branch, preferably issue-<issuenumber> as branchname.
[14:00] <sayan> ^^ that's what I follow
[14:00] <sayan> Questions?
[14:01] <pavan> sorry i am late which topic going on
[14:01] <im_mohsin> !
[14:01] <skat_sd> !
[14:01] <asraisingh> !
[14:01] <sayan> next
[14:01] <im_mohsin> when forking you get access to only to a specific branch?
[14:02] <schubisu> !
[14:02] <Padfoot7> !
[14:02] <ani> roll call : Aniket uttam
[14:02] <im_mohsin> Or all branches besides main branch?
[14:02] <sayan> im_mohsin: when you are fork you will create a copy of the project in your account
[14:02] <rkased> !
[14:02] <sayan> im_mohsin: it's under own command now
[14:02] <im_mohsin> ok. so any changes will only affect my copy of project?
[14:03] <sayan> im_mohsin: basically, you can read everything in the main repo, not write
[14:03] <sayan> im_mohsin: any changes in main repo will not be copied to your repo
[14:03] <im_mohsin> okay got it
[14:03] <vivek_> *at the point of forking
[14:03] <sayan> vivek_: at the point of forking?
[14:03] <hemanth_> !
[14:04] <vivek_> sayan: ah, sorry
[14:04] <vivek_> i read it wrong
[14:04] <sayan> it's like you have a directory.
[14:04] <sayan> and you create a copy of the directory
[14:05] <sayan> when you copy every file gets copied
[14:05] <_anshul> !
[14:05] <sayan> but the changes in the main directory are reflected after that
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <skat_sd> is this forking same as "clone the repository" option we get while downloading a repo from git?
[14:05] <sayan> skat_sd: no
[14:05] <yurii> !
[14:06] <sayan> skat_sd: forking is creating a copy of the repository
[14:06] <sayan> skat_sd: cloning is creating a local copy in your system
[14:06] <sayan> skat_sd: it downsloads the repo from the server
[14:06] <sayan> next
[14:06] <asraisingh> sayan, what it there is already an branch and the branch has issue? Should we have to use the case like bw under sepia?
[14:06] <hemanth_> roll call hemanth
[14:07] <asraisingh> sayan, and branches are only made when there is an issu?
[14:07] <mdbk> !
[14:07] <asraisingh> sayan, sorry s/iss/issue
[14:07] <sayan> asraisingh: I did not get you
[14:07] <sayan> next
[14:08] <sayan> vivek_: can you take this question?^^
[14:08] <skat_sd> but sayan, then what does cloning do? this page<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5143119/what-does-this-mean-clone-the-github-repository> says that cloning is also creating a local copy.
[14:08] <sayan> skat_sd: local copy, as in in your system/laptop/computer
[14:08] <im_mohsin>  skat_sd yes creating a local copy in your system
[14:09] <asraisingh> sayan, ok. I will elaborate you the condition after the class.
[14:09] <sayan> asraisingh: sure
[14:09] <sayan> next
[14:09] <im_mohsin> and fork creates a copy in your github
[14:09] <Padfoot7> sayan: Is it necessary to work on the issue in a different branch ?
[14:09] <sayan> Padfoot7: it is not necessary, but not recommended also
[14:09] <sayan> Padfoot7: it's better to work on a different branch
[14:10] <skarpy> !
[14:10] <sayan> Padfoot7: there are project, for which it is compulsory though
[14:10] <sayan> s/project/projects
[14:10] <sayan> like for example CPython
[14:10] <bhavin192> asraisingh, I got your question, I think yes you have to create a new branch from the branch from which you want to fix the issue
[14:10] <sayan> next
[14:10] <rkased> how to you deal with progress from the main branch once you've forked a specific branch. e.g. Say my pace is slower than the main branch pace and I want to incorporate the latest updates as well as not lose the progress I've made on my own so far.
[14:10] <Padfoot7> okay, thanks
[14:11] <sayan> rkased: you pull the changes from the main branch and push the changes to your branch
[14:11] <sayan> rkased: and that's why you work on a branch
[14:11] <rkased> cool!
[14:11] <rkased> thanks
[14:11] <hemanth_> which branch should we fork for contribution, can i get some example
[14:11] <sayan> so that you don't have to worry about your changes to come in between
[14:11] <ahole[m]> !
[14:11] <skat_sd> !!
[14:11] <skat_sd> oops
[14:11] <skat_sd> !
[14:11] <sayan> hemanth_: out of turn you are
[14:11] <sayan> next
[14:11] <hemanth_> oops sorry
[14:11] <asraisingh> bhavin192, thanks again.
[14:11] <ashwanig> hemanth_, You fork the repo not the branch
[14:12] <sayan> hemanth_: you don't fork a branch, you fork a repo
[14:12] <sayan> next
[14:12] <_anshul> how to make sense of their project, which may now has 1000s line of code and many files
[14:13] <sayan> _anshul: laters
[14:13] <sayan> next
[14:13] <sayan> next
[14:13] <mdbk> sayan: Based on your example issue-<issuenumber>, are you fixing the bug/issue on that particular line number?
[14:13] <yurii> whan you fork do you change the name of project
[14:14] <ashwanig> yurii, No,
[14:14] <sayan> mdbk: I will explain that
[14:14] <bhavin192> mdbk, no, it's the issue number
[14:14] <sayan> yurii: no, no needed
[14:15] <sayan> shall I move to the demo?
[14:15] <mdbk> Okay
[14:15] <yurii> ok
[14:15] <sayan> or continue with question?
[14:15] <mohsin> yeah move please
[14:15] <jasonbraganza> move on
[14:15] <ashwanig> yes move to demo
[14:15] <poojaencoded> move to the demo
[14:15] <ikshitij> move to demo Sayan
[14:15] <messifc> Sorry I have to leave.
[14:16] <asraisingh> sayan, Can I share some terminal configuration which is helpful to others also?
[14:16] <skat_sd> sayan, will you just answer this: difference between fork and clone? I did search on SO, and both seem to be the same thing. Both creates local copy on a system. Please enlighten?
[14:16] <ahole[m]> Yeah! a demo would clear things up a bit.
[14:16] <_anshul> can I answer this
[14:16] <sayan> asraisingh: nope
[14:16] <sayan> skat_sd: laters
[14:16] <asraisingh> sayan, ok
[14:17] <sayan> *- So fire up your browser, open https://github.com/sayanchowdhury/venus
[14:18] <sayan> *- In the top right corner, you should see a fork option.

[14:21] <hemanth_> asraisingh, hey it takes some time to load
[14:21] <sayan> asraisingh: connect what?
[14:21] <sayan> etherpad? it takes time
[14:21] <sayan> patience is the key

[14:22] <bhavin192> asraisingh, it's Internet capital I
[14:22] <sayan> Anybody who is still fighting?
[14:22] <ahole[m]> sayan:  I guess there are way too many users on etherpad so I guess it's slow.
[14:23] <sayan> ahole[m]: no, it does not happen
[14:23] <sayan> Okay moving ahead
[14:23] <ravindra> https://github.com/ravindra-lakal/venus
[14:25] <sayan> Now everybody, hit the terminals and type git clone <repo_url> // repo_url = the forked repo url

[14:26] <skat_sd> !
[14:26] <bhavin192> clone it in a different directory than `foobar`
[14:26] <skat_sd> from the foobar directory?
[14:26] <sayan> thanks bhavin192
[14:26] <mohsin> done
[14:26] <sayan> This is a completely new repo/project
[14:27] <sayan> so do this in the home folder
[14:27] <ganeshnomula_> !
[14:27] <sayan> this should be seperate from the foobar one
[14:27] <sayan> next
[14:27] <sayan> pooja__: did not get you
[14:27] <sayan> next
[14:27] <sayan> next
[14:27] <sayan> next
[14:28] <ikshitij> Got it ! Pass
[14:28] <sayan> nexxt
[14:28] <sayan> next
[14:28] <pooja__> after pasting fork url what to do?
[14:28] <sayan> pooja__: press enter
[14:28] <ganeshnomula_> sayan: So now we have to make a new directory, for that do we have to do git init  and all again?
[14:28] <yurii> !
[14:28] <sayan> ganeshnomula_: no you donot have to do a git init
[14:28] <championshuttler> pooja_ : press enter and it will come to your local directory
[14:28] <sayan> just clone the repo
[14:29] <skat_sd> sayan, do we do it in the home or in any folder in home?
[14:29] <anuG> i got disconnected.Someone please help me what to do.
[14:29] <sayan> skat_sd: any folder should work
[14:29] <ahole[m]> !
[14:29] <bhavin192> skat_sd, directory other than `foobar`
[14:29] <sayan> skat_sd: basically this is a completely new project
[14:29] <sayan> next
[14:29] <mohsin> anuG, which part you missed?
[14:29] <skat_sd> sayan, so no specific name for everyone to follow here, right?
[14:30] <sayan> anuG: git clone <cloned repo url>
[14:30] <yurii> i first cloned from foobar
[14:30] <championshuttler> anug : clone this repo https://github.com/sayanchowdhury/venus then paste your repo link in this https://etherpad.gnome.org/p/dgplug-github-url
[14:30] <bhavin192> championshuttler, wait wait
[14:31] <sayan> First you need to fork the repo in github: https://github.com/sayanchowdhury/venus
[14:31] <sayan> and then then copy the new forked repo url
[14:31] <sayan> and type
[14:31] <sayan> git clone <forked repo url>
[14:32] <sayan> forexample
[14:32] <sayan> pooja would do
[14:32] <sayan> git clone https://github.com/iampooja/venus.git
[14:32] <sayan> yurii: is that clear?
[14:33] <sayan> If you are not able to find the url
[14:33] <sayan> Look for the Clone or download button in green
[14:33] <sayan> Click the button, a dropdown will appear
[14:33] <avik> !
[14:33] <sayan> and then click Use HTTPS:
[14:33] <sayan> copy the url
[14:33] <yurii> sayan --it is clear. I mean first I did git clone from foobar directory and then you told from home
[14:33] <pooja__> sayan i didn't get you
[14:34] <sayan> and then do git clone <forked repo url>
[14:34] <sayan> pooja__: what did you not get?
[14:34] <sayan> next
[14:34] <sayan> next
[14:34] <avik> why do we clone by terminal and not downloading the zip from browser?
[14:34] <ahole[m]> Can you do a git clone on any repo even the ones which you have not yet forked ? And did you accept the fork  requests or anyone can fork any repo ?
[14:35] <sayan> avik: try it yourself? it will download a zip for for you
[14:35] <pooja__> after pasting url nothing is happen
[14:35] <mohsin> ahole[m], we can clone any repo
[14:35] <ikshitij> ahole[m]: Yes, you can ! It's like downloading a file
[14:35] <bhavin192> ahole[m], anyone can fork too
[14:35] <avik_> sayan: yes, then unzip it?
[14:35] <sayan> pooja__: I cannot help with copy+paste issues
[14:35] <sayan> avik_: yes, but it will not be a git repo
[14:36] <avik_> ok got it
[14:36] <sayan> avik_: rather a project folder
[14:36] <sayan> next
[14:36] <ikshitij> pooja__: use "git clone <url>
[14:36] <sayan> ahole[m]: any repo it works
[14:36] <pooja__> and after that ikshitij?
[14:36] <skarpy> pooja__: "git clone https://github.com/iampooja/venus" will do
[14:36] <bhavin192> avik_, it will be without .git directory
[14:36] <sayan> ahole[m]: but at the end of the day you need to clone the repo to push your changes and create PR
[14:37] <ikshitij> pooja__: wait :)
[14:37] <avik_> !
[14:37] <sayan> next
[14:37] <avik_> if cloning from any place workd, then why forking?
[14:37] <avik_> *works
[14:38] <sayan> avik_: think
[14:38] <sayan> I am not going to tell
[14:38] <skarpy> avik_: to see them inside our repo list.
[14:38] <skarpy> sayan:oops sorry sayan
[14:38] <sayan> I have already told that earlier
[14:38] <sayan> skarpy: no, that's not the reason
[14:38] <ikshitij> avik_: avik git add filename ! Do you want to do that again and again?
[14:38] <championshuttler> avik_ to make pull request to that project :)
[14:39] <ikshitij> skarpy: wrong !
[14:39] <skarpy> sayan: cloning will not add them in repo list of github, but forking will. cloning is locally saving. right?
[14:39] <avik> oooo ok!
[14:40] <avik> skarpy, yes, but eventually, after completion of task, you will upload. then its same
[14:40] <sayan> okay now people who are not fighting with cloning, create a commit that would add a new file hellovenus.txt (remember to do it in a new branch)
[14:40] <ikshitij> avik_: skarpy : clone is just plain download and forking is dealing with git standard (in simple language) :p
[14:40] <skarpy> ikshitij: yes :D
[14:41] <bhavin192> ikshitij, I think it's not like that
[14:41] <sayan> ikshitij: no, wrong
[14:41] <avik> ikshitij,  :D got it!
[14:41] <ikshitij> bhavin192: I was too informal :p
[14:41] <apoorv>  sayan: can you please give the command for that as I have missed the previous sessions?
[14:41] <sayan> apoorv: nope, this is a task
[14:41] <mohsin> sayan, should we create a new branch for venus?
[14:42] <apoorv> sayan : okay
[14:42] <sayan> bhavin192: can you help out apoorv in PM?
[14:42] <sayan> mohsin: yup
[14:42] <bhavin192> sayan, sure
[14:42] <yurii> !
[14:42] <sayan> next
[14:43] <ikshitij> !
[14:43] <sayan> next
[14:43] <asraisingh> sayan, done.
[14:43] <ashwanig> sayan, done
[14:44] <ikshitij> "add a new file hellovenus.txt" add where ?
[14:44] <asraisingh> ikshitij, in new branch
[14:44] <sayan> ikshitij: venus
[14:45] <ikshitij> ok
[14:45] <sayan> next
[14:45] <sayan> Who all are still doing?
[14:45] <avik> anything to write in the file? or just create a blank file hellovenus.txt?
[14:45] <sayan> avik: your wish
[14:46] <avik> okay
[14:46] <mohsin> i committed hellovenus.txt in separate branch sayan
[14:46] <gauravsitlani> !
[14:46] <sayan> mohsin: cool
[14:46] <sayan> next
[14:46] <ikshitij> Done !
[14:46] <gauravsitlani> after adding the file hellovenus.txt should we push it?
[14:47] <sayan> gauravsitlani: yes, that's the next step
[14:47] <sayan> now people push the branch
[14:47] <sayan> I repeat, people push the branch to our repo
[14:47] <sayan> And create a PR: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/
[14:48] <mohsin> sayan, push the branch to origin like git push origin <branch-name>?
[14:48] <soumam007> please sayan last 2 line elaborate
[14:48] <soumam007> !
[14:48] <sayan> next
[14:48] <soumam007> do we need to create remote
[14:48] <soumam007> ?
[14:49] <sayan> soumam007: how can you check which all remotes are already there?
[14:49] <soumam007> git remote -v
[14:49] <sayan> soumam007: yes, type that and see what is that output?
[14:50] <soumam007> origin created by you already
[14:50] <soumam007> :)
[14:50] <ashwanig> sayan, done
[14:50] <sayan> Folks, if you do git remote -v
[14:50] <sayan> you will see the origin remote
[14:51] <sayan> now when you clone the repo, the origin is automatically create by git to communicate with the remote repo
[14:52] <skarpy> we have to push branch venus, right?
[14:52] <asraisingh> skarpy, new branch which we have created.
[14:53] <ashwanig> skarpy, Yes, the new branch you created
[14:53] <sayan> skarpy: yes
[14:53] <skarpy> done
[14:54] <hemanth_> !
[14:54] <soumam007> !
[14:54] <sayan> next
[14:54] <sayan> next
[14:54] <hemanth_> should we push the master or remote branch our repository
[14:54] <championshuttler> done :)
[14:55] <ikshitij> done
[14:55] <asraisingh> done
[14:55] <soumam007> Even after pushing Â´newÂ´ branch why cant i see my hellovenus.txt in remote repo
[14:55] <soumam007> ?
[14:55] <yurii> !
[14:55] <hemanth_> sorry remote/venus branch
[14:55] <ashwanig> soumam007, you are in master branch. Change the branch
[14:55] <sayan> hemanth_: venus
[14:55] <mohsin> hemanth_, you push the branch you created now
[14:55] <sayan> soumam007: no clue, wish I had a wand
[14:55] <sayan> the harry potter one
[14:56] <hemanth_> ok thanks
[14:56] <soumam007> -_-
[14:56] <cran-cg_> soumam007 on the extreme left 4th row from above you see a branch option on Github, change that to your branch
[14:56] <soumam007> cran-cg_, ashwanig yes i got your point
[14:56] <soumam007> :) thanks
[14:57] <sayan> soumam007: you did not check yesterday?
[14:57] <soumam007> yes i did i forgot today in the github portion
[14:58] <soumam007> i checked only in the terminal today
[14:58] <soumam007> go ahead
[14:58] <sayan> soumam007: ok
[14:58] <sayan> I am going to office, I will be back
[14:58] <hemanth_> hey I am getting scared as it is showing my branch in sayan's repo also
[14:59] <skarpy> pull request gone, now sayan, you have to accept request to make change to the main repo?
[14:59] <hemanth_> so what to do next
[15:00] <ahole[m]> Take a break, till sayan  comes back.
[15:01] <akshayg96> skarpy, yes
[15:01] <asraisingh> ahole[m], have a kitkat.
[15:01] <cran-cg_> So anyone still struggling, can ask
[15:01] <samridhia> !
[15:02] <cran-cg_> samridhia I guess sayan is away, ask anyhow
[15:02] <championshuttler> samridhia you can ask questions
[15:02] <ikshitij> what's output of git remote -v in your system ?
[15:02] <abhinavshirur> sorry, I messed up with the title the first time. So I closed the PR and sent a new one
[15:02] <jasonbraganza> samridhia, only sayan controls batul :) ask cran-cg_ directly :)
[15:02] <samridhia> I am still not getting where to push branch
[15:02] <akshayg96> abhinavshirur, :D
[15:03] <jasonbraganza> samridhia what are you typing in your terminal?
[15:03] <asraisingh> ikshitij, origin	https://github.com/asraisingh/venus (fetch)
[15:03] <asraisingh> origin	https://github.com/asraisingh/venus (push)
[15:03] <championshuttler> samridha: to the repo you forked to your profile
[15:03] <samridhia> git push origin venus
[15:03] <ikshitij> jasonbraganza: do you know, we should use 'add', 'added', or 'adding' ?
[15:03] <mohsin> samridhia, git push origin <your-branch-name>
[15:03] <abhinavshirur> akshayg96, I am a super noob :P
[15:03] <mdbk> cran-cg: having challenge with the pull request
[15:03] <cran-cg_> ikshitij: https://pastebin.com/zNUt2XqL
[15:03] <jasonbraganza> ikshitij - whatever the projectâs convention says. Right now anything goes :)
[15:04] <samridhia> mohsin, getting an error as 'origin' does not appear to be a git repo
[15:04] <hemanth_> mdbk, what's the challenge
[15:04] <mdbk> can't make a pull request
[15:04] <bhavin192> mdbk, why?
[15:05] <jasonbraganza> samridhia - git branch - what does that tell you?
[15:05] <skarpy> ikshitij check whatsapp
[15:05] <mohsin> samridhia, what do you get when do git remote -v?
[15:05] <samridhia> moshin, nothing! i am not getting any output
[15:05] <skarpy> mdbk https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/
[15:05] <ikshitij> jasonbraganza: according to git documentation, you should use present tense (imperative) only
[15:06] <jasonbraganza> ikshitij - so adding :)
[15:06] <cran-cg_> mdbk: Sorry had to recieve a call
[15:06] <samridhia> jacsonbraganza, * venus
[15:06] <mdbk> confused on the base and compare
[15:07] <jasonbraganza> samridhia try git push -u origin venus
[15:07] <mohsin> samridhia, that is weird. you have to get something like this: https://pastebin.com/3bmDQdQU
[15:07] <pooja__> i am still not what to do after git clone<url>?
[15:07] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, it should not make any difference
[15:07] <cran-cg_> mdbk: compare is like diff, and you compare it with sayan's main repo, so base is sayan's main repo cause you want your changes to be reflected there
[15:08] <mohsin> pooja__, create a new branch after cloning
[15:08] <ikshitij> jasonbraganza: yes I have seen people(Contributors) using 1st form only !  For example: 'add'
[15:09] <samridhia> jasonbraganza, same error as origin does not appear in repo
[15:09] <bhavin192> samridhia, have you cloned the repo?
[15:09] <samridhia> yes bhavin192
[15:09] <ikshitij> pooja__: Make a clone, (2). Create new branch (3). Add hellovenus.txt (4) push to origin (5). Create PR
[15:10] <mohsin> samridhia, can you send us the error message
[15:10] <jasonbraganza> samridhia - paste the full error at https://paste.fedoraproject.org
[15:10] <bhavin192> then your repo should have origin
[15:10] <jasonbraganza> and send us the link
[15:11] <jasonbraganza> samridhia - also what bhavin192 said
[15:11] <cran-cg_> mdbk: You there with me ? Did I confuse you more ?
[15:11] <samridhia> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/qV5-KM-yaMJWOaZGm3ne7A
[15:11] <mdbk> cran-cg: still confused
[15:11] <samridhia> jasonbraganza,  yes i cloned after that i create a branch in the home folder is that a error?
[15:12] <mdbk> the base has master and compare has master as well
[15:12] <cran-cg_> mdbk: please say it then :))
[15:13] <mdbk> The pull request will be from sayan's repo right?
[15:13] <bhavin192>  samridhia don't know the reason why your repo does not have origin
[15:13] <jasonbraganza> bhavin192 - samridhiaâs problem seems to be above my pay grade. want to help? samridhia, the only thing I can think of is to do it all again
[15:13] <skat_sd> i am getting this: fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository. how to make the origin?
[15:13] <cran-cg_> mdbk: Compare sayan's base with your cloned repo's new branch, not your cloned repo's master branch
[15:13] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, no it's easy to fix
[15:13] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, think about it
[15:14] <soumam007> samridhia, did you clone by terminal or by clicking?
[15:14] <samridhia> jasonbraganza,  i tried doing again but destination path 'venus' already exists and is not an empty directory.
[15:14] <samridhia> soumam007, by terminal after forking it
[15:14] <bhavin192> samridhia, you are in venus directory, right?
[15:14] <cran-cg_> mdbk: It's like you are requesting sayan to add your changes to his repo.
[15:15] <samridhia> no bhavin192
[15:15] <bhavin192> samridhia, and cloned *your* GitHub fork
[15:15] <jasonbraganza> samridhia  - pm?
[15:15] <cran-cg_> samridhia: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32238616/git-push-fatal-origin-does-not-appear-to-be-a-git-repository-fatal-could-n/32238628
[15:15] <bhavin192> samridhia, then how it git will know what to do
[15:15] <ikshitij> skat_sd: git remote set-url origin <url>
[15:16] <sayan> yes, back
[15:16] <soumam007> samridhia, open .git> refs> remotes in the venus folder just by clicking you will get if origin is present or not
[15:16] <samridhia> bhavin192, so i have to make a folder venus and then clone ?
[15:16] <bhavin192> samridhia, no
[15:16] <cran-cg_> mdbk: Did it help?
[15:16] <ikshitij> samridhia: folder will be created automatically
[15:16] <mdbk> cran-cg: Thanks alot
[15:16] <sayan> So who are are still facing issues?
[15:17] <samridhia> soumam007,  .git in which folder?
[15:17] <bhavin192> samridhia, then cd into it
[15:17] <skat_sd> i ikshitij is the origin the one we pasted in the fedora paste?
[15:17] <mdbk> Have done that
[15:17] <mohsin> bhavin192, i think samridhia  did not fork sayan repo
[15:17] <soumam007> venus folder samridhia which you have cloned
[15:17] <ikshitij> samridhia: you are cloning a repo, that is folder itself
[15:18] <sayan> After I remote the mute, I want to know who are still stuck? Rest donot answer
[15:18] <sayan> Yes, so who all are still stuck
[15:18] <skat_sd> me

[15:32] <bhavin192> skat_sd, untracked files have 'venus' O.o

[13:56] <kushal> next
[13:56] <sandeepK> soumam007: welcome
[13:57] <NikitaK3> While installing python 2 packages while using python 3 is it necessary to always have python-<package_name> in command line?
[13:57] <ikshitij> soumam007_: By the way copy 'error or error code' and Google ! It will help you and you will get the reason also.
[13:57] <kushal> Phi_mb, system package means it will be installed system-wide, and that is supposed to be well tested along with the other packages in the distribution. We never told anything about pip to people here, so some people are just trying to act smart.
[13:58] <kushal> NikitaK3, you have to give the right package name.
[13:58] <ahole[m]> kushal: Agreed! it was really quick in fedora. And I even got time to update my pip and install pandas for my Data mining class tomorrow,.
[13:58] <kushal> NikitaK3, Which distribution are you using?

[14:01] <anuGupta> Is there any difference between sudo dnf install and sudo dnf -y install ? I searched but could not find it.<EOF>
[14:01] <kushal> NikitaK3, search by using "apt-cache search docutils"
[14:01] <kushal> and see what are the actual package names.
[14:01] <bhavin192> anuGupta, try it once
[14:01] <ghishadow`> anuGupta, you don't need to confirm with Yes with -y
[14:02] <kushal> anuGupta, Yes, if you provide -y, then you don't have to type yes :)
[14:02] <skat_sd> anuGupta, -y basically means you are already saying yes to download
[14:03] <anuGupta> Yes I did sudo dnf install but it gave failed to synchronize repo updates whereas sudo dnf -y install perfectly installedl
[14:03] <adas0496> on Ubuntu this should work: "sudo apt-get install python-docutils python-sphinx"
[14:04] <anuGupta> Thanks everyone :)
[14:04] <NikitaK3> kushal, okay thank you
[14:05] <bhavin192> anuGupta, Sometimes it may fail

[14:20] <ashwanig> <eof>
[14:20] <kushal> yes
[14:20] <kushal> those are different ways to write comments

[14:21] <gauravsitlani> I did not understand doctest blocks.
[14:22] <gauravsitlani> please can you elaborate?<eom>
[14:22] <jiteshpabla> Why is rst important? when we already have markdown?
[14:22] <kushal> gauravsitlani, skip that, we are yet to do Python.
[14:22] <kushal> jiteshpabla, because it has way more things to do proper technical documentations.
[14:23] <im_mohsin> !
[14:23] <kushal> jiteshpabla, and we will learn more about why in the coming weeks.
[14:23] <kushal> next
[14:23] <im_mohsin> kushal, section title are centered. can we change it?
[14:23] <kushal> im_mohsin, Yes, you will have to pass CSS to the command
[14:24] <kushal> im_mohsin, search about it, I never did it
[14:24] <im_mohsin> oh okay. so after we convert that to html and we can design more with css. Thanks
[14:24] <kushal> jiteshpabla, At least one thing we will learn at the end today.
[14:27] <soumam007_> looks like the man pages :)

[14:32] <ahole[m]> <eom>
[14:32] <kushal> next
[14:33] <ashwanig> Some section titles are smaller than sub section title. Why?<eof>
[14:33] <kushal> ashwanig, paste the .rst file please
[14:34] <kushal> ahole[m], "1. item 1 pizza" should show 1. item 1 pizza

[14:35] <kushal> next
[14:35] <lucifer> where we will be using it?
[14:35] <kushal> lucifer, what rst? In documentation, and also in code in Python.

[14:35] <im_mohsin> sorry
[14:35] <ashwanig> kushal, I made a mistake. Sorry for that.

[14:43] <kushal> samridhia, Have you seen footnotes in books or research papers?
[14:44] <sandeepK> kushal, now got this "test.rst:9: (ERROR/3) Unexpected indentation."
[14:44] <samridhia> no! actually i don't know what footnotes are?
[14:44] <samridhia> I will google it
[14:44] <kushal> sandeepK, means you have wrong indentation on that line

[14:16] <kushal> On 30th June, Gnome project did a tweet.  https://twitter.com/gnome/status/880601488346632194

[14:17] <kushal> As a reply Miguel De Icaza made this particular tweet: https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/880813770653782017
[14:18] <kushal> Please have a look at the reply.

[14:19] <realslimshanky> rollcall: Shashank Kumar
[14:20] <avik_> kushal, what does "ship software" mean?
[14:21] <gauravsitlani> I feel its right that people stood for the community.
[14:21] <adas0496> Abhishek Das
[14:21] <adas0496> I didn't know that Gnome and FSF are political movements
[14:22] <kushal> adas0496, Okay.
[14:22] <Phi_mb> Like any political movement, free and open source software are meant for good.
[14:22] <jasonbraganza> Miguel was right. We code and work as a community. Seems only fair we stand for otherâs rightts
[14:22] <gauravsitlani> I'm thinking if Aaron Swartz was alive, he would have really supported that statement.
[14:22] <poojaencoded> i am not in twitter
[14:22] <Phi_mb> And we should take a stand for those who contribute to these movements.
[14:22] <jiteshpabla> I couldn't really understand the tweet
[14:22] <gauravsitlani> And done much more.<eom>
[14:22] <kushal> jiteshpabla, Okay.
[14:23] <ahole[m]> i think gnome is right cause community is made of people, so what good is a community if it can't stand for people.
[14:23] <adas0496> To effectively realize the goals of FS movement, however, political support is necessary
[14:23] <kushal> avik, search about what does it mean by shipping software.
[14:23] <ravindra> Free software is a movement by the people and for the people and Gnome is a free software so there is nothing wrong if they care for such issues
[14:23] <im_mohsin> jasonbraganza, yes absolutely
[14:23] <Cyber_freak> I think he(miguel) is right  as in the immigration ban gnome is showing support and open source community is all about different people helping and building communites that function as a whole.
[14:24] <samridhia> I think it should be choice of Gnome and if they are doing it for community's welfare then people should not be against it.
[14:24] <arush> Roll Call: Arush
[14:24] <ikshitij> kushal: I think, that's right! A community doesn't only mean for working together but also supporting each other !
[14:26] <kushal> Okay.
[14:26] <bhavin192> I think, supporting some people from community during their hard time is not a bad thing
[14:27] <cignatious> we come together without checking the religion and origin of other people and that is what matters; contributing and collaborating and achieving goals together
[14:27] <skarpy> bhavin192: hard time?
[14:27] <kushal> To know about the history of hacking and Free Software movement, we have to go back to 1955-1956, to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
[14:27] <kushal> TX-0 (pronounced tixo) was an early, fully transistorized computer and contained a then-huge 64K of 18-bit words of magnetic core memory.
[14:28] <im_mohsin> samridhia, i feel standing for ones right is not a choice. They did it for showing that contribution and collaboration of every member is only way forward for a inclusive community
[14:28] <kushal> t was located on the second floor of building 26, at the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), at MIT
[14:28] <ikshitij> avik_ shipping "anything" means delivering it to someone (customer) ! (As per my knowledge)
[14:28] <kushal> (which later spun off to become the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab).
[14:28] <kushal> Before this computer, they had access to IBM computers (which were very restrictive in nature).
[14:29] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-0 this is the computer.
[14:29] <soumam_> !
[14:30] <kushal> People who did not have official access to this computer started figuring out better ways to get access.
[14:30] <kushal> next
[14:30] <soumam_> kushal,  restrictive in the sense?
[14:30] <soumam_> ok proceed
[14:30] <soumam_> :)
[14:31] <kushal> soumam007__, like they did not have any access to the source code of the operating system.
[14:31] <soumam_> ok
[14:32] <kushal> Many people who booked time to access the computer may have skipped sleep at nights to gain access (think of access times like 3 AM),
[14:32] <kushal> and an enthusiastic group of people (mostly from the Tech Model Railroad Club) would try to access the computer in that free time.
[14:32] <kushal> Working on this computer became a way of life.
[14:32] <kushal> Groups of people started staying back whole nights on the computer, and they made sure no time was wasted.
[14:33] <kushal> Is this clear till now?
[14:33] <yurii> yes
[14:33] <Cyber_freak> yes
[14:33] <championshuttler> yes

[14:34] <ikshitij> Yes
[14:34] <im_mohsin> kushal, what people actually doing with there access?
[14:35] <kushal> im_mohsin, Writing code to improve different tools, things which were not possible before.
[14:35] <kushal> This brings to these people who are known as hackers in this early days of computing.
[14:35] <kushal> That also brings us to anther big term.
[14:35] <kushal> Hacker Ethic
[14:35] <kushal> From Steven Levyâs book:
[14:36] <kushal> >Access to computersâand anything which might teach you something about the way the world worksâshould be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
[14:36] <rkased> yes
[14:36] <kushal> This boils down to the idea of a world, where you can fix things. If a hacker thinks something is wrong, they can open it up, and fix it.
[14:36] <kushal> You can build exciting things on top of existing knowledge. And, to
[14:36] <kushal> do so, hackers believed that â¦
[14:36] <kushal> > All information should be free.
[14:37] <kushal> The only way this was possible by exchanging information in a free manner. There was to be no boundary around information.
[14:37] <kushal> Now, MIT has a big history many amusing hacks by its students.
[14:38] <kushal> If you want to know about the history of famous hacks in MIT, have a look at http://hacks.mit.edu/
[14:39] <ghishadow> i was literally reading about this before class, what a coincidence :)

[14:42] <kushal> ### The PDP-1 days
[14:42] <kushal> In 1961, a new computer from DEC was delivered to MIT, the PDP-1.
[14:42] <kushal> The
[14:42] <kushal> price for this computer was much lower compared to the TX-0.
[14:43] <kushal> $12000 iirc
[14:43] <skarpy> dollars?
[14:43] <kushal> $ is dollars
[14:43] <kushal> It was installed in the room right next to the TX-0.
[14:44] <kushal> The hackers did not like the existing tooling (assembler) for PDP-1, and so over a weekend, a few people got together and converted the TX-0 assembler for use with the new computer.
[14:45] <kushal> They started working from Friday, by Monday morning, they had it ready.
[14:45] <kushal> Between themselves they worked 240+ hours on that.
[14:45] <kushal> It was said, that were a similar effort made by the computer industry, it would have taken months of effort
[14:46] <kushal> Because of all the open information available, the hackers of MIT managed to showcase the value of the hacker ethic.
[14:46] <kushal> * all of the
[14:46] <ihp_> Amazing. :o
[14:46] <kushal> The source code of various programs was kept in drawers in the lab, for any one to access.
[14:46] <kushal> People used to pick up work done by others, then improve the code, and put the new improved tapes right back in the drawer.
[14:47] <im_mohsin> 240+ hours of works. That's possibly the huge commitment by these hackers :o
[14:47] <kushal> This way everyone got the chance to learn from work of others and their improvements.
[14:47] <ihp_> kushal, And that
[14:48] <kushal> Now think about some problem you worked on, kept the tape in the drawer, went home, when you came back next day morning, someone magically improved the code, and you have new version there.
[14:48] <ihp_> 's how we humans develops.
[14:48] <ihp_> kushal: sorry sent by mistake.
[14:49] <kushal> ### The Chess Story
[14:49] <kushal> After making a connection between the PDP-1 and the TX-0, he hackers invited Prof. John McCarthy to sit in front of it, and play a game of chess.
[14:49] <kushal> The information was transferred to the TX-0 one bit at a time, where they had also invited another professor to sit. Both of them were told, they were playing against the computer.
[14:49] <kushal> :)
[14:50] <kushal> Only after playing the
[14:50] <kushal> first few moves, McCarthy tried to find out the reason behind slow output, and then discovered the other professor in the TX-0 room (after following the cable connecting the computers).
[14:52] <kushal> ### Spacewar!
[14:52] <kushal> Steve Russell was one of the hackers who had used the TX-0 before and was then working on the PDP-1 system.
[14:52] <kushal> He had the idea of making an application (a game) which would use the display system and some futuristic sci-fi story of two spaceships battling each other.
[14:53] <kushal> But, to do so, he would require better sine-cosine routines (think about functions) for the display to work.
[14:54] <kushal> Kotok (who worked on the assembler), went to visit the DEC folks in a nearby city, and someone there provided him with the source code for the sine-cosine routines.
[14:55] <kushal> ^^^ Now take some time to think about this, people just went to ask the folks from the company, and they shared the code to solve the problem.
[14:55] <kushal> After many intense six-eight hour sessions, in February 1962, they had the initial game ready.
[14:56] <kushal> 2 ships firing torpedoes at each other. But, as usual, the hackers at the lab thought of various improvements they could make, and the game got many new features over time.
[14:56] <kushal> People would stand in line to play the game (whenever the system was free).
[14:56] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg
[14:56] <kushal> ^^ that is the picture of an original display.
[14:57] <soumam_> firing how? no display nothing?
[14:57] <kushal> soumam007__, Have you opened the photo link?
[14:58] <kushal> If you have any questions, this is a good time to raise those.
[14:58] <ihp_> Is that a oscilloscope screen in the picture? <eom>
[14:59] <soumam_> sorry kushal my irc is getting disconnected frequently i missed the photo link
[14:59] <im_mohsin> kushal, the DEC guys gave the routine without any resistance?
[14:59] <vishami3>  soumam https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!#Gameplay
[14:59] <kushal> im_mohsin, Nope, they were happy to help.
[15:00] <avik> ihp_,  some first generation CRT dispaly
[15:00] <kushal> im_mohsin, They even provided hardware parts to people  at times.
[15:00] <ahole[m]> How was pdp-1 different from tx-0?
[15:01] <kushal> ahole[m], read the wikipedia page for both the computer :))
[15:01] <skat-sd> kushal, the 1st Version control system came in 1982. How did these guys make a stable os for the pdp-1 in 3 days without it?
[15:01] <gauravsitlani_> i just saw the pic of Vint Cerf playing that game.
[15:01] <ahole[m]> kushal: okay.
[15:01] <kushal> skat-sd, They made an assembler, using code in paper.
[15:02] <kushal> http://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/  this is the game inside our browser, feel free play as much as you want after the session.
[15:02] <kushal> Now, let us jump into 1970
[15:02] <im_mohsin> that was really good kushal and spacewar went on to become the classic game of the century :)
[15:02] <siddhesh> im_mohsin, software was not sold commercially back then
[15:03] <siddhesh> they were basically experiments people would do and share with each other
[15:03] <soumam_> hahah they were too brilliant
[15:03] <kushal> A freshman (math) student from Harvard, Richard M. Stallman heard about the AI computer lab at MIT.
[15:03] <kushal> He visited the place and found out how open the lab was (compared to Harvardâs computer labs).
[15:03] <kushal> MIT was famous for the open culture.
[15:04] <kushal> He also managed to get a job there to write a PDP-11 simulator to run on the labâs PDP-10.
[15:04] <kushal> From the very next week, he started visiting the place regularly and working on open terminals.
[15:04] <kushal>  He was introduced to hackers from the lab.
[15:05] <kushal> He also liked the idea where hackers would do anything to keep access to the terminals open.
[15:05] <kushal> That included picking the locks of
[15:05] <kushal> the doors, removing ceiling tiles, or climbing walls.
[15:05] <kushal> brb, (another meeting in another channel), please continue discussing
[15:05] <ikshitij> siddhesh: then who started this trend of selling source code or software ?
[15:05] <kushal> Even though
[15:05] <kushal> there were many Academics in the AI Lab, the hacker ethic was accepted as a norm.
[15:06] <kushal> Okay, I have couple of minutes
[15:06] <kushal> Stallman started visiting the lab routinely every weekend.
[15:06] <kushal> A group of hackers used to go out together for dinner (mostly Chinese), and they used to come back and hack through the night.
[15:06] <jiteshpabla> So, was the hacker ethic still limited to MIT?
[15:06] <kushal> And sometimes at 3 AM
[15:06] <kushal> they used to again go out for more Chinese food :)
[15:06] <kushal> Many of the hackers used to stay up all night including Stallman.
[15:06] <siddhesh> ikshitij, I don't know TBH, it probably started with hardware companies bundling OSes with their machines without source code
[15:07] <siddhesh> ikshitij, but then software as a sole business was something microsoft created and perfected
[15:07] <kushal> With who all here stays up late night and hack on things.
[15:07] <im_mohsin> siddhesh, i dont think software were not sold commercially back then. They were and licensing was not mostly to protect there creation
[15:07] <kushal> During the 1970s, computer usage in the labs changed slowly. Many other users (of the other Operating Systems) slowly started adding security features to their systems, which included having password controlled access.
[15:07] <kushal> The MIT computer science department did install such a system in 1977.
[15:08] <kushal> Stallman managed to get access to the source code and wrote another program which would then decrypt the password.
[15:08] <kushal> He mailed the users with a message to change their password to a âcarriage returnâ (just pressing the enter key).
[15:08] <kushal> All most one-fifth of the staff agreed to this, and they had empty passwords.
[15:09] <kushal> Stallman joined MIT as a Physics grad student. He spent months in the Lab (he had no apartment at the time).
[15:09] <siddhesh> im_mohsin, yes, but holding back source code wasn't the norm originally, because the source code was essentially paper tapes and punch cards :)
[15:09] <kushal> By October 1975, he left his grad classes, and started working in the AI Lab full time.
[15:09] <kushal> The lab was filled with plenty of such individuals, who never finished their academic degrees.
[15:09] <siddhesh> s/wasn't the norm/was not possible/
[15:09] <kushal> The homegrown operating system for the Lab's PDP-10 was called the Incompatible Time Sharing system (ITS).
[15:10] <kushal> The name was pun on the labâs original operating system, the Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS).
[15:10] <kushal>  ITS was written and maintained by the folks in the Lab (from PDP-6 days).
[15:11] <kushal> You can see that they did not miss any chance to have fun, if possible, even in names (which continued through out the history of hacks).
[15:11] <kushal> brb (meeting chat in the other channel).
[15:14] <gauravsitlani_> How did that culture affect Academics?
[15:14] <gauravsitlani_> Did people tend to drop out from their courses?
[15:15] <ahole[m]> gauravsitlani_: yes, it did affect their academics and in some cases people never completed their degrees.
[15:15] <siddhesh> gauravsitlani_, it coincides with the hippie movement of the 60s and 70s, so the campus was essentially full of the 'free thinkers'
[15:15] <kushal> gauravsitlani_, Many did not.
[15:15] <kushal> gauravsitlani_, Which is still a case for many we know, even in India.
[15:16] <ikshitij> kushal: what type of language they were using ?
[15:16] <siddhesh> also it would be incorrect to correlate non-completion of degrees with hacker culture. That is more of an American thing, where society is far more pragmatic than any other place like India or even parts of Europe
[15:16] <im_mohsin> kushal, can you point somecases here in India?
[15:16] <kushal> im_mohsin, later after the session.
[15:16] <im_mohsin> sure
[15:17] <siddhesh> for example, you will see far fewer such stories of dropoutsin EU despite some stellar hackers there (like Linus Torvalds!)
[15:17] <jiteshpabla> siddhesh: true
[15:18] <gauravsitlani_> siddhesh, those kinds of things should be encouraged in colleges.
[15:19] <jasonbraganza> ikshitij - assembly for the most part. (directly coding to the machine with the intructions given by the vendor)
[15:20] <deepika> kushal How did it spread out of MIT,to even bigger hacker culture ?
[15:20] <bhavin192> ikshitij, you can see the source code of spacewar
[15:20] <jiteshpabla> The society was much more relaxed and forgiving back then for this to happen
[15:20] <siddhesh> there were a number of programming languages by the 70s I think: lisp, C, fortran
[15:21] <jasonbraganza> siddhesh - was thinking early 60s :) sorry!
[15:21] <siddhesh> jasonbraganza, paper tapes, punch cards and a keyboard with 1s and 0s maybe :P
[15:22] <jasonbraganza> yup :)
[15:22] <siddhesh> no but in all seriousness you're right, other than paper tapes and punch cards you basically had to write an assembler in machine language and then load that assembler to assemble whatever program you wrote in assembly
[15:22] <bhavin192> siddhesh, keyboard with two switches xD
[15:24] <jasonbraganza> bhavin192 - you saw the spacewar code right? thatâs assembler :)
[15:24] <gauravsitlani_> I feel communities are amazing as they help to create such culture which inculcates our desire to explore more.
[15:24] <siddhesh> gauravsitlani_, our problem here in India is very different and is increasingly becoming the problem in the US - taking up courses for the jobs and not for their interest
[15:25] <siddhesh> but that is a different topic, so lets not digress :)
[15:25] <kushal> Back.
[15:25] <ahole[m]> The issue in gauravsitlani_ India is that
[15:25] <ahole[m]> In India degree is everything.
[15:26] <kushal> Richard M. Stallman is also known as RMS,  so for the rest of the session, I will use either of the terms.
[15:26] <im_mohsin> siddhesh, i agree. In India we are having narrow approach to free thinking
[15:26] <gauravsitlani_> siddhesh: sure that will point to a different direction now.
[15:26] <kushal> Next
[15:26] <kushal> ### TECO and the Birth of Emacs
[15:27] <kushal> Text Editor and COrrector was the primary editor in the AI Lab. One had to give long edit commands ending with a âend of command stringâ sequence.
[15:27] <kushal> That meant one could not see the text while editing it.
[15:27] <kushal>  It was upgraded from the PDP-6 days, and with a special hack it used to show both the original text, and a place to enter command strings in a split screen.
[15:27] <kushal> Richard Stallman found a hack called âCtrl-Râ for TECO,
[15:27] <kushal> where by pressing those two keys, one could use the editor on a keystroke to keystroke basis.
[15:27] <kushal> But, it used to take only the first 5 rows on the top of the screen.
[15:28] <kushal> Stallman hacked it to use the whole screen, and (more importantly) anyone could now save their macros to some set of fixed keystrokes.
[15:28] <kushal> This created a new revolution; that of using macros.
[15:28] <kushal> Everyone started creating their own macro packages, and their own keystrokes.
[15:30] <kushal> All these macros made this scene in real life : https://xkcd.com/1806/
[15:30] <kushal> This also brought the issue of too much customization, since one hacker could not sit in front of another hacker's terminal and use it.
[15:31] <kushal> ^^ the exact comics above :)
[15:31] <jasonbraganza> XD
[15:31] <gauravsitlani_> It's hilarious :D
[15:31] <kushal> Guy Steele, another hacker in the lab decided to do something to solve this issue.
[15:32] <kushal> He started creating a chart of macro commands along with 4 different macro packages.
[15:33] <kushal> This project got the attention of Stallman, and he started looking into it with more attention.
[15:33] <kushal> Finally, this gave birth to a new project, named *Emacs*, for editing macros.
[15:33] <kushal> People slowly started adopting this new editor.
[15:33] <kushal> But, there was a good chance that people would write  or develop some special features, which others would want to use.
[15:33] <rkased> !
[15:34] <kushal> And so, in the Emacs documentation,
[15:34] <kushal> Stallman added a contract (he looked at it as a social contract)
[15:34] <kushal> saying Emacs âwas distributed on a basis of communal sharing, which means
[15:34] <kushal> that all improvements must be given back to me to be incorporated and
[15:34] <kushal> distributed.â
[15:34] <kushal> next
[15:34] <rkased> Curious, who was funding all of these efforts, in addition to any additional time the researchers/hackers committed
[15:34] <kushal> rkased, The Lab.
[15:34] <rkased> Okay.
[15:34] <kushal> rkased, People used to work for the Lab too, they had their formal office work/research.
[15:35] <kushal> Plus all of these fun activities.
[15:35] <rkased> Cool.
[15:35] <jasonbraganza> stallman was what we would now call the in house devops guy
[15:35] <kushal> his allowed Stallman to add useful features (from the users) to Emacs, and share the improved work.
[15:35] <kushal> jasonbraganza, hahaha
[15:35] <im_mohsin> what are macro packages?
[15:35] <skat-sd> so, basically that was the birth of pull request
[15:36] <kushal> im_mohsin, some piece of code which will do something (by pressing some keys together).
[15:36] <im_mohsin> okay
[15:36] <rkased> !
[15:36] <kushal> next
[15:37] <rkased> When you say they built an application or macros or something. How is it built? I'm not clear how these commands where understood and communicated to the computer?
[15:37] <rkased> I apologize for my novice computer language question.
[15:38] <kushal> rkased, This are the computers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10
[15:39] <kushal> rkased, Using paper tapes as siddhesh said before.
[15:39] <rkased> Got it.
[15:39] <kushal> rkased, and for teco or emacs, directly using the display.
[15:40] <kushal> Now, there are also many stories from this time
[15:40] <kushal> ### The Story of Pretty Printing
[15:40] <kushal> Steele also had the idea to add a feature that would reformat source code, so that it would more readable.
[15:40] <kushal> One morning he sat down at the terminal, with Stallman looking over his shoulder, and they both  worked on this feature for the next 10 hours. Stallman telling, and Steele typing.
[15:40] <kushal> At the end they made it; within a 100 lines.
[15:41] <kushal> Later while describing how focused the session was, Steele said the following.
[15:41] <kushal> >My first thought afterward was [that] it was a great experience,
[15:41] <kushal> very intense, and that I never wanted to do it again in my life.
[15:41] <kushal> When he came out of the lab, it was already late night, he had no clue about the time he spent there working in full focused mode :)
[15:42] <kushal> Now, a little bit of sidestory. The Unix story
[15:42] <kushal> The Unix operating system grew in popularity during 1970s.
[15:42] <kushal> Open up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix#/media/File:Ken_Thompson_(sitting)_and_Dennis_Ritchie_at_PDP-11_(2876612463).jpg
[15:42] <kushal> This is a famous picture of Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie working on a
[15:42] <kushal> PDP-11 computer (this is most probably taken during the time they
[15:42] <kushal> wrote Unix in C programming language).
[15:43] <kushal> People had to purchase licenses from AT&T to use Unix.
[15:43] <kushal> Around 1975, Berkeley university also started working on their own Unix operating system, known as BSD. But, to get a copy of the BSD tape, one had to produce a copy of AT&T license, as BSD had code from AT&T Unix.
[15:43] <kushal> Okay, again break for questions.
[15:43] <kushal> ANy question?
[15:44] <poojaencoded> no
[15:44] <kushal> Continuing then
[15:44] <kushal> ## Lisp machines
[15:44] <gauravsitlani_> Did they have full code of UNIX , the guys at berkley?
[15:44] <kushal> gauravsitlani_, Yes I think.
[15:44] <kushal> Now if we look back what else was happening in the AI world during those days, one major project was Lisp machines.
[15:44] <kushal> Richard Greenblatt and Thomas Knight started building computers which could run lisp instructions at the hardware level, known as MIT Lisp Machines.
[15:45] <kushal> [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LISP_machine.jpg)
[15:45] <kushal> is an early version of one such lisp machine.
[15:45] <kushal> By 1980, two companies sprung from the Lisp machine work in the AI Lab.
[15:46] <kushal> Symbolics had external funding, and also managed to get 14 hackers from the lab to work on their version of the Lisp machine. On the other side was LISP Machines, Inc. (LMI), which had Greenblatt leading the team, comprising of the rest of the hackers from the AI Lab (except RMS).
[15:46] <kushal> Both the groups worked at the AI Lab, and had licensed
[15:46] <kushal> the Lisp Machine operating system code from MIT.
[15:46] <kushal> According to the license, they had to return any improvement of the code back to the MIT (so that MIT could use the code).
[15:46] <kushal> Even though license did not mention anything about the redistribution of those changes, they allowed it as an gentlemanâs agreement, as everyone benefited from the work.
[15:46] <kushal> But, on March 16, 1982,
[15:46] <kushal> Symbolics decided to stop sharing code, electing to enforce the letter of the license.
[15:47] <kushal> The AI LAB had to choose to honor the Symbolics license and could not share the code if they were to get newer updates.
[15:47] <kushal> The hope was to destroy LMI as a competitor.
[15:48] <kushal> RMS was angry.
[15:48] <kushal> This made RMS vengefully, choose a side (LMI).
[15:48] <kushal> He started reading the changes made by Symbolics, and re-implementing them (in a completely different way) into MIT Lisp Machine Operating system.
[15:48] <kushal> The executives from Symbolics (did not believe) installed a *spy* program on Stallmanâs terminal to find evidence against him.
[15:49] <kushal> When (in early 1983) these were presented to the AI Lab administrators, Stallman successfully showcased how his work was different, and any similarity in the code was from before the fork of the source code.
[15:49] <kushal> The Lab administrators allowed him to continue his work.
[15:49] <kushal> Stallman also started reading only the documentation from Symbolics (without reading the source code), and implementing the features into the MIT Lisp Machine.
[15:49] <kushal> LMI thus had access to the changes made by RMS, benefitting from the work, just like all other users of the MIT Lisp Machines in the Lab.
[15:50] <kushal> In RMSâs own wordsâ¦
[15:50] <kushal> >I was going to punish Symbolics if it was the last thing I did.
[15:50] <kushal> This also brought changes within personal relationships. The same hackers who used to go out for dinner together, started going out in different groups.
[15:50] <kushal> The estrangement went up to such levels where some old friends even started avoiding RMS (or lying to him) about such trips.
[15:51] <kushal> Stallman stood his ground and kept adding similar features to the MIT Lisp Machine (also providing the same to LMI).
[15:51] <kushal> Symbolics had a group of legendary hackers working on their system, but on the other side RMS ***worked alone*** on these features.
[15:51] <kushal> This made him special, even to the people from the Symbolics group.
[15:51] <kushal> Levyâs book has a comment from Bill Gosper.
[15:52] <kushal> >I can see something Stallman wrote, and I might decide it was bad (probably not, but somebody could convince me it was bad), and I would still say, âBut wait a minute â Stallman doesnât have anybody to argue with all night over there. Heâs working alone! Itâs incredible anyone could do this alone!â
[15:52] <kushal> RMS became the legend in everyone's mind.
[15:54] <kushal> ### Changing the World
[15:54] <kushal> But, while RMS was fighting this war, the world of computers was also changing very fast
[15:54] <kushal> There were many personal computers released and their software came without any source code, and under NDAs (Non disclosure agreements), and EULAs (End User License Agreements).
[15:54] <kushal> and there was also the famous story of the printer :)
[15:54] <kushal> In 1980, the then 27 year old RMS was waiting for a 50 page print job to be done.
[15:54] <kushal> This was supposed to be printed on a printer made & gifted by Xerox Palo Alto Research Facility.
[15:55] <kushal> But, it was stuck, and not for the first time. Like many other problems, Stallman wanted to fix this issue, but he could not find any corresponding source code for the system.
[15:55] <kushal> Later he figured out that some researcher in the Carnegie Mellon university had access to the source code.
[15:55] <kushal> A few months later, when he visited the university, he met the researcher and asked for a copy of the source, which the researcher refused.
[15:56] <kushal> One reason was a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) he(the researcher) signed with Xerox.
[15:56] <kushal> This was RMS's first encounter with an NDA. To him this was the path to betray
[15:56] <kushal> all users, making them victims of proprietary software.
[15:57] <kushal> He felt him and other users became victim of this NDA.
[15:57] <kushal> Which was complete against of all the hacker ethic.
[15:57] <kushal> On September 27, 1983, Stallman sent out an announcement over Usenet
[15:57] <kushal> newsgroup net.unix-wizards about a new *New UNIX implementation*.
[15:57] <kushal> >Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete
[15:57] <kushal> Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnuâs
[15:57] <kushal> Not Unix), and give it away free to everyone who can use
[15:57] <kushal> it. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment
[15:57] <kushal> are greatly needed.
[15:57] <kushal> He also added a note about himself.
[15:57] <kushal> >I am Richard Stallman, inventor of the original much-imitated EMACS
[15:57] <kushal> editor, now at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT. I have worked
[15:57] <kushal> extensively on compilers, editors, debuggers, command interpreters,
[15:57] <kushal> the Incompatible Timesharing System and the Lisp Machine operating
[15:57] <kushal> system. I pioneered terminal-independent display support in ITS. In
[15:57] <kushal> addition I have implemented one crashproof file system and two window
[15:57] <kushal> systems for Lisp machines.
[15:58] <kang9> What's gluster kushal
[15:58] <kang9> Do people still use usenet
[15:58] <kang9> Do you guys use it
[15:58] <kang9> Have its client?
[15:58] <kushal> kang9, please ask after the session.
[15:59] <kushal> In January, 1984, Stallman resigned from the MIT staff, so that he could work on GNU without any legal hurdles. His friends helped him to have his own office in the lab, he did consulting work to earn money.
[15:59] <kushal> In 1985 he released GNU Emacs,
[15:59] <kushal> and followed it up with *The GNU Manifesto* (soon after the original
[15:59] <kushal> announcement).
[15:59] <kushal> As the popularity of GNU Emacs in the Unix community slowly started rising, Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) with help from friends.
[16:00] <kushal> He became the president, and other friends  joined the board of directors.
[16:00] <kushal> Robert Chassell (who worked at LMI) was one of the board members, and helped as Treasurer of the foundation. He also wrote really great documentation,
[16:00] <kushal> and later wrote the manual for Emacs Lisp.
[16:00] <kushal> Sad news is that he passed away a few days ago :(
[16:01] <kushal> The FSF also started sending out bulletins, you can read the first one https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt
[16:01] <kushal> Free as in Freedom became the center of focus.
[16:01] <kushal> Now, I will talk a bit about the time line of how different software (we still use them) came upl.
[16:01] <kushal> * up
[16:02] <kushal> In 1985, along with a release of Emacs, RMS also introduced a
[16:02] <kushal> General Public License for Emacs. Which he later hacked more on, and gave
[16:02] <kushal> birth to The GNU General Public License (GPL). The 1.0 version of the
[16:02] <kushal> license was released in 1989.
[16:02] <kushal> Anwesha will take a session to explain software licenses and copyrights.
[16:02] <kushal> By January 1987, GNU *ls*, *grep*, *make*, *ld* were already out in the world.
[16:02] <kushal> Someone wrote the first copy of the free *tar* utility.
[16:03] <kushal> *cron*, *at* and *m4* commands were also getting ready. *awk* was in its final testing stage, and people were still writing the *diff* command.
[16:03] <Cyber_freak> sorry some urgent work came up, have to leave in the middle of the session.
[16:03] <kushal> *gdb* was already written in 1986 (running only on Vax,  Suns).
[16:03] <kushal> GNU *cc* was also getting ready (it could generate good Vax code,
[16:03] <kushal> and also good 68000 and 68020 code). They expected to
[16:03] <kushal> release the complete system by 1987 itself.
[16:03] <kushal> GNU Chess, Bison, and the X Window System were also ready
[16:03] <kushal> MIT Scheme was ready to be used (but without any
[16:03] <kushal> documentation).
[16:03] <kushal> LMI provided office space, computer resources, and a mailing address for the foundation.
[16:03] <kushal> By February 1988, Berkeley Unix started releasing parts of their Unix as Free Software.
[16:04] <kushal> They also started using GNU *make*, *awk*, *sh* from the
[16:04] <kushal> GNU project. They also had planned to release *csh* (from BSD) as free
[16:04] <kushal> software.
[16:04] <kushal> Brian Fox started implementing the Bourne-again Shell (Bash),
[16:04] <kushal> and it was completed by June of the same year. GNU Make was also
[16:04] <kushal> marked as ready for release.
[16:04] <kushal> Ronald McGrath also almost finished a complete set of the ANSI C library. GNU *malloc*, *regexp*, and the *termcap* library were already ready.
[16:05] <kushal> siddhesh, now works on this ^^^ c library :)
[16:05] <kushal> Furthermore, Michael Tiemann
[16:05] <kushal> wrote the GNU C++ compiler as an extension of GCC, along with GDB+, to
[16:05] <kushal> debug C++ code. Tiemann was a graduate student at Stanford University,
[16:05] <kushal> keeping a close watch on GNU development.
[16:05] <kushal> In 1990, along with
[16:05] <kushal> John Gilmore and David Henkel-Wallace, Tiemann started a new software
[16:05] <kushal> consulting company called Cygnus (Cygnus, Your GNU Support). By the
[16:05] <kushal> end of first year, they had contracts worth $725,000. They were
[16:05] <kushal> marked as the first for-profit corporation providing commercial
[16:05] <kushal> support exclusively for free software.
[16:05] <kushal> NeXT, Inc. also started using GNU Emacs, GCC, GAS and GDB in their operating system, thus becoming the first computer manufacturer to do so.
[16:06] <kushal> By mid 1990, FSF was shipping Emacs Lisp reference manual, it was 550 pages, and cost $50.
[16:06] <kushal> The GNU project had everything working, but without a perfect operating system.
[16:06] <kushal> In 1991, a Finish student, Linus Torvalds, wrote a mail about his
[16:06] <kushal> hobby project, a kernel for an operating system (for 386 clones). He
[16:06] <kushal> had already ported Bash to it. For the 0.1 (the first one) release, it used its
[16:06] <kushal> own license. In December 1992, he released the 0.99 version of Linux
[16:06] <kushal> kernel using the GNU GPL license.
[16:06] <siddhesh> and since we are on the topic of roland, he retired this week after 30 years: https://lwn.net/Articles/727383/
[16:07] <kushal> ^^ now imagine :)
[16:07] <kushal> The kernel, along with many other GNU projects created a perfect storm;
[16:07] <kushal> a complete operating system to be used by the Free Software followers. The void
[16:07] <kushal> of a working kernel in the GNU project was filled up by the Linux
[16:07] <kushal> kernel. This is why RMS calls the operating system GNU/Linux
[16:07] <kushal> rather than the term many people use, Linux.
[16:07] <kushal> Remember the term, GNU/Linux.
[16:07] <kushal> If you see the dgplug summer training announcement, you will see the same.
[16:08] <kushal> By 1993, there were over 100 developers working on this new
[16:08] <kushal> kernel. Slackware, the first distribution (still in use)
[16:08] <kushal> came out. The Debian project also started later that
[16:08] <kushal> same year.
[16:08] <kushal> In 1994, Mark Ewing started the Red Hat Linux distribution. It soon merged
[16:08] <kushal> with Bob Youngâs ACC Corporation, and the new company was named Red
[16:08] <kushal> Hat Software. In August 11, 1999, Red Hat went public, and later in
[16:08] <kushal> November it aquired Cygnus. Michael Tiemann became the CTO of the
[16:08] <kushal> company. Currently he is serving as vice president of open source
[16:08] <kushal> affairs.
[16:08] <bkero> 'eh? GNU had HURD
[16:08] <bkero> Hurd*
[16:08] <kushal> bkero, They had, but Linux was a better fit.
[16:09] <bkero> Better fit than the kernel born and raised in the GNU project? :)
[16:09] <kushal> and also got better developer attention.
[16:09] <jasonbraganza> bkero - wasnât quite ready at the time. too unstable
[16:09] <kushal> Meanwhile in Palo Alto, California, in 1998, a group of free software
[16:09] <kushal> folks met, and came up with the term âOpen Sourceâ as it was a better
[16:09] <kushal> fit (in their eyes) for companies who were scared to install and
[16:09] <kushal> use free software. Later, in February, 1998, Bruce Perens and Eric
[16:09] <kushal> S. Raymond founded Open Source Initiative (OSI).
[16:09] <kushal> ^^ that is the Open Source term you all know.
[16:10] <kushal> But, everything started with Free Software movement, which is about the freedom of users.
[16:10] <kushal> In every possible way.
[16:10] <kushal> This brings back to the tweet from Miguel, we happen to work on software to help people with their freedom.
[16:10] <kushal> The hacker ethic still prevails.
[16:11] <jasonbraganza> olÃ©!
[16:11] <siddhesh> bkero, GNu still has hurd, just that it is not well supported
[16:11] <kushal> That made us to do this training.
[16:11] <jiteshpabla> wow
[16:11] <gauravsitlani_> Amazing
[16:12] <sayan> bkero | 'eh? GNU had HURD <-- GNU still has it
[16:12] <sayan> :p
[16:12] <kushal> That made us to write software, made to share whatever we know, learn from each other.
[16:12] <siddhesh> glibc has a hurd port which is broken now and then.  It's a nice toy project if anybody is interested in playing with it
[16:12] <rkased> Your words played in my head like a movie. I was able to visualize that summary of history.
[16:12] <rkased> Thank you
[16:12] <kushal> rkased, Wait, it is not finished yet :)
[16:12] <kushal> Now, a lot of history i learned is from a book
[16:13] <kang9> Free software is possible; why Free hardware doesn't exist yet?
[16:13] <siddhesh> the breaking point for hurd was the 'micro-kernel' debate actually
[16:13] <kushal> kang9, It does, search youself.
[16:13] <kushal> * yourself
[16:13] <siddhesh> it aspired to be the modern OS kernel and was designed as a true microkernel
[16:14] <kushal> The first book to read is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution
[16:14] <siddhesh> by the time it became somewhat stable, linux had already become popular enough that nobody cared about hurd anymore
[16:14] <kushal> Next book is available on a free license,  "Free as in Freedom".
[16:15] <kushal> http://web.archive.org/web/20150103152231/https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-2.0.pdf
[16:15] <SpEcHiDeR> https://h-node.org/
[16:15] <kushal> Please read these two books with your own pace.
[16:15] <kushal> But, remember to read both.
[16:15] <kushal> The history is important. Learn about it.
[16:15] <kushal> Now, we are open to questions, type ! as usual.
[16:15] <kushal> next
[16:15] <ghishadow> siddhesh, the debate between Linus Torvalds vs Andrew S. Tanenbaum on microkernel vs monolithic kernel ?
[16:16] <rkased> !
[16:16] <kushal> next
[16:16] <kushal> ghishadow, Please follow rules.
[16:16] <rkased>  What would you say are some similar efforts going on today?
[16:16] <siddhesh> ghishadow, kind of.  Not directly related though
[16:16] <kushal> Btw, there is also a documentary called "Revolution OS".
[16:16] <kushal> rkased, efforts on?
[16:17] <jasonbraganza> rkased - the DGPLUG Summer Training!
[16:17] <rkased> Yes
[16:17] <kushal> jasonbraganza, :)
[16:17] <siddhesh> ghishadow, the thought then was that microkernels are the future and that linux was a good stopgap, but not good enough
[16:17] <joyhimanshu> jasonbraganza : true
[16:17] <kushal> next
[16:17] <kushal> Any one else, any more questions?
[16:18] <ravindra> !
[16:18] <kushal> I know this was long, but it had to happen in one go.
[16:18] <kushal> next
[16:18] <soumam007_> It's a long long journey :)
[16:18] <ravindra> Why there is no GNU BSD ?
[16:19] <rkased> !
[16:19] <kushal> ravindra, Because they use different License, but they are also part of the Free Software world.
[16:19] <kushal> ravindra, As I said above, they use the same technologies.
[16:19] <kushal> next
[16:20] <soumam007_> My eyes got heavy reading so much; i guess how much work they had done and still doing ;)
[16:20] <kushal> soumam007_, It is not *they*, it is us.
[16:20] <jasonbraganza> ravindra - Thr BSDs descend from Berkely and their ditributions of Unix. GNU results from the efforts of RMS and team at the FSF.
[16:20] <soumam007_> Kushal :) hehe
[16:21] <rkased> Free as in freedom is mentioned, how about free as in free in money?
[16:21] <jasonbraganza> ravindra - different people, different places, is all
[16:21] <siddhesh> ravindra, the FSF story concludes in the GNU/Linux ecosystem while the BSD story concludes with the Mac
[16:21] <kushal> rkased, It is not, depends on cases.
[16:21] <siddhesh> gross oversimplification of course :)
[16:22] <anwesha> It feels nice to feel that we are a part of a revolution
[16:22] <siddhesh> ravindra, but the stories are heavily intertwined.  You must be using a lot of tools from the BSD ecosystem already, like openssh
[16:22] <kushal> next
[16:22] <kushal> Any other question anyone?
[16:23] <balaji> No
[16:23] <kushal> I don't think we should do the license session today.
[16:23] <kushal> It will be on Wednesday.
[16:23] <siddhesh> rkased, the free in FSF is definitely not as in money.  It is something that gets confused quite often
[16:23] <soumam007_> If gnu Linux is free why red hat charges?
[16:23] <soumam007_> I am not sure enough though
[16:23] <siddhesh> soumam007_, support, updates and maintenance
[16:23] <kushal> soumam007_, Red Hat charges for the support.
[16:23] <jasonbraganza> soumam007_ - if you can install and configure stuff on your own, Red Hat is free!
[16:23] <siddhesh> soumam007_, and trademarks
[16:24] <kushal> You get updates and help from support.
[16:24] <siddhesh> jasonbraganza, not RHEL, you're still infringing on the trademark license
[16:24] <siddhesh> you can use centos though
[16:24] <kushal> CentOS is the answer.
[16:24] <jasonbraganza> siddhesh - yes, but that is why they coopted CentOS no?
[16:24] <soumam007_> Kushal not for the os? And utilities?
[16:24] <kushal> soumam007_, Nope.
[16:25] <kushal> The word "Free" is for freedom, not as in free beer.
[16:25] <skarpy> Kushal :)
[16:25] <siddhesh> jasonbraganza, RH did not make centos if that's what you mean.  centos happened by itself and then recently RH merely hired all the engineers that were working on centos and declared that they will aid its development
[16:25] <kushal> Before we close the session, here is one trick from the last session.
[16:25] <soumam007_> Was it necessary to open so much distribution of Linux? I can  get the point of doing so
[16:26] <jasonbraganza> siddhesh - i meant your part after the hiring :)
[16:26] <soumam007_> *cant
[16:26] <kushal> The rst presentation you all read is actually written in rst itself.
[16:26] <kushal> Here is the source: https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2012/rst-primer/talk.rst
[16:26] <kushal> I used rst2s5 command to create the presentation.
[16:26] <siddhesh> jasonbraganza, yeah

[13:39] <poojaencoded> hi anwesha
[13:39] <anwesha> Today we are going to discuss some boring but (unfortunately important) matters/concepts
[13:39] <skat_sd> good evening anwesha
[13:39] <anuGupta> anwesha : Hello
[13:40] <anwesha> Good everyone thanks :)
[13:40] <gauravsitlani> Licensing?
[13:40] <_RicharD_> Roll Call: Mayank gupta
[13:40] <anwesha>  Lets roll the Tardis and go to  November 2017
[13:40] <anwesha> You have finished the summer training.
[13:41] <anwesha> All excited to gather so much knowledge about open source, programming, irc, git -- the list is endless.
[13:41] <anwesha> Feeling all set to conquer the world.
[13:41] <theoaradoxer02_> Roll Call: Mannu Gupta
[13:41] <ahole[m]> Lawyer and organizer of Pyladies. You have degree in both computer science and law. anwesha  wow! you appear to be like harvey specter+Mark zukerburg.
[13:42] <kushal> ahole[m], please stop talking in the middle of the session.
[13:42] <anwesha> You have done a project in your summer training session.
[13:42] <anwesha> Uploaded it in github or bitbbucket or in any other platforms.
[13:42] <poojaencoded> anwesha how you managed both the things
[13:42] <poojaencoded> ?
[13:42] <kushal> poojaencoded, Follow the rules please.
[13:42] <anwesha> Now starts the big wait, anticipation that you will get an user.
[13:42] <anwesha> You are setting alarms after every one hour to check if anyone is using it. Nope no user.
[13:42] <poojaencoded> sorry ,kushal
[13:42] <anwesha> February 2018
[13:43] <ahole[m]> kushal: sorry
[13:43] <anwesha> You have come to attend PyCon Pune, sad, shattered.
[13:43] <anwesha> While people are discussing how they are adding new features to their project as per the requirement of the users, you are keeping silent, no user till date.
[13:43] <anwesha> Suddenly you heard someone discussing about Intellectual property, copyright  etc, with a very serious expression on their faces.
[13:43] <anwesha> You think, âWhat happened to these people? Why they are discussing these boring things in such cool technical conference?â
[13:44] <anwesha> But could not move out with all your setup. And stay there.
[13:44] <anwesha> You get to gather more information about the law, licenses.
[13:44] <anwesha> Wait a minute is this why my project does does have an user?
[13:44] <anwesha> * Wait a minute is this why my project does not have an user?
[13:45] <anwesha> Eureka you have the answer.
[13:45] <anwesha> What exactly have you heard? understood?
[13:46] <ravindra> Roll call Ravindra Lakal
[13:46] <jiteshpabla> Are you looking for responses from us, anwesha?
[13:46] <anwesha> you header that the one small  (big thing) you missed was to choose a license for your project. So, people abstained from using/working your project.
[13:46] <Phi_mb> Please continue. I want to know what happened.
[13:46] <anwesha> You wish you had not missed the licensing session (thought it to be boring)
[13:47] <anwesha> You wish
[13:47] <anwesha> Roll the Tardis
[13:47] <anwesha> Back in 12th July, 2017:

[13:51] <SpEcHiDeR> sorry! accidentaly typed ! . The same question was asked previously.
[13:51] <anwesha> ok
[13:51] <anwesha> Continuing
[13:53] <anwesha> The area of law which we primarily belong to is Intellectual Property
[13:53] <anwesha> So, todayâs session begins with a introduction to Intellectual Property
[13:53] <anwesha> As the name suggests âintellectual propertyâ is a property created by and related to someoneâs intellect.
[13:53] <anwesha> It is a way , one of legal structures to protect our intangible assets.
[13:54] <anwesha> (Intangible means something which do not have physical structure. )
[13:54] <fxkundan> kunal
[13:54] <anwesha> Such as creativity, goodwill, reputation etc.)
[13:54] <anwesha> There are different kinds of intellectual property such as Copyright, Trade Marks, Patents, Trade secrete, Geographical Indications etc.
[13:54] <fxkundan> messifc
[13:54] <anwesha> For todayâs session we are only going to deal with Copyright and to be specific very area of copyright, software license.
[13:55] <anwesha> I shall not be taking any question other than that particular area.
[13:55] <pr97> roll call: Priyanka Sharma
[13:55] <anwesha> Anyone has any question so far?
[13:56] <anwesha> ok
[13:56] <anwesha> continuing
[13:56] <anwesha> Copyright
[13:57] <anwesha> Now the question that comes to your mind is - what is copyright?
[13:57] <anwesha> To understand the term copyright let us dissect the word copyright.
[13:57] <anwesha> If we flip the word Copy Right it comes as
[13:57] <anwesha> Right Copy
[13:57] <anwesha> right over a copy,
[13:57] <anwesha> right to copy.
[13:57] <anwesha> Copyright is an exclusive right to :
[13:58] <anwesha> 1. use,
[13:58] <anwesha> 2. distribute,
[13:58] <anwesha> 3. sell the original creation
[13:58] <anwesha> granted for a limited period of time,
[13:59] <anwesha> by the sovereign, i.e the government.
[13:59] <anwesha> You don't need to apply for the copyright, one automatically gets it.
[13:59] <anwesha> Though copyright is an exclusive right but it is not absolute, there are certain limitations to it.
[13:59] <anwesha> Types of works protected:
[13:59] <anwesha> The Indian copyright law protects literary works, dramatic works, musical works, artistic works, cinematography films and sound recordings
[14:00] <anwesha> Having said that it may frown some eyebrows that the developers don't do something like that.
[14:00] <anwesha>  But actually you do.
[14:00] <anwesha> To achieve an answer how a programmer will code is her personal choice and "expression".
[14:01] <anwesha> That makes you an "Artist", a "code poet" isn't that cool!
[14:02] <anwesha> Apart from Acts, Law of the land there are some important conventions and treaties that governs the regime of Copyright.
[14:02] <jasonbraganza> <3 "code poet"
[14:02] <anwesha> Anyone has any question?
[14:02] <fxkundan> !
[14:02] <ashwanig> !
[14:02] <skat_sd> !
[14:02] <Phi_mb> !
[14:02] <anwesha> next
[14:02] <ashwanig> Why copyright is granted for a limited period of time?<eom>
[14:02] <SpEcHiDeR> !
[14:02] <fxkundan> What does you mean when you say one automatically gets the copyright
[14:02] <ashwanig> oops sorry
[14:03] <skat_sd> How do we automatically get a copyright if we never applied for it in the First place? How does the government know that i need one?
[14:03] <kushal> skat_sd, ashwanig Next time if you ask out of order, we will happily remove you from the sessions.
[14:03] <skat_sd> asked earlier than my turn, sotty
[14:03] <skarpy> !
[14:03] <skat_sd> s/sotty/sorry
[14:03] <theoaradoxer02_> !
[14:03] <ahole[m]> !
[14:04] <NikitaK3> !
[14:04] <skat_sd> kushal, accidentally pressed the enter key, had the question typed out, sorry
[14:05] <anwesha> fxkundan, that you dont have to go to the Registers office to get/have your right over your creation. As soon as you make,create something (there are certain conditions to it) it is considered as your property.
[14:06] <anwesha> next
[14:06] <skat_sd> How do we automatically get a copyright if we never applied for it in the First place? How does the government know that i need one?
[14:06] <ashwanig> Why copyright is granted for a limited period of time?<eom>
[14:07] <bhavin192> skat_sd, :-/
[14:07] <anwesha> ashwanig,  so that after the period is over the benefit of the invention can be enjoyed by the public at large.
[14:07] <anwesha> next
[14:07] <Phi_mb> Question already asked and answered. :)
[14:08] <skat_sd> answered, thanks
[14:08] <anwesha> next
[14:08] <anwesha> next
[14:08] <SpEcHiDeR> Why should a person apply for copyright? Why cannot the person release whatever project he makes in the public domain, (if he does not wish to sell the software)?
[14:09] <deepika_> !
[14:10] <bhavin192> SpEcHiDeR, what if someone uses your code and sell it as they have made it?
[14:10] <anwesha> SpEcHiDe,  I will take that question in the Public Domain section. Please remind me once. Thanks
[14:10] <anwesha> next
[14:10] <skarpy> how the law knows, who the product actual belongs to? if i automatically get copyright. Is there any relation of this with patent for product?
[14:10] <balaji> !
[14:11] <samridhia> !
[14:11] <SpEcHiDeR> bhavin192: what if the person in the example does not care? (I think it would be an hypothetical case) but still asking?
[14:11] <anwesha> skarpy, the question if "law knows" or not that comes when and where there is a legal action brought to the court.
[14:11] <adas0496> !
[14:12] <Phi_mb> !
[14:12] <skarpy> anwesha: yes, i am talking about such conditions, also what about patent for products?
[14:14] <anwesha> skarpy, so then many things/terms/situations arise such as circumstantial  evidence, first to apply or first to invent etc. Then if you have registered your work that registration helps.
[14:14] <skarpy> thanks :) <eom>
[14:14] <anwesha> skarpy, Patent is not connected here in this particular case.
[14:14] <skarpy> anwesha, ok.
[14:15] <anwesha> next
[14:15] <theoaradoxer02_> Does 'distribute' means anyone can modify and submit code to original ?
[14:15] <theoaradoxer02_> One more thing, let us say singing is my art , how can one be exploited , why we need copyright there ?
[14:16] <anuGupta> !
[14:18] <anwesha> theoaradoxer02_,   "distribute" here includes both giving it to someone as it is, and /or re-distributing the modified version.
[14:18] <anwesha> next
[14:18] <skarpy> theoaradoxer02_: using others music, tone, vocals etc., for your own personal gain. publicity, attracting listeners/viewers without the consent of the person who is the rightful owner cause exploitation.
[14:19] <anwesha> next
[14:19] <im_mohsin> theoaradoxer02_, I sing a particular song using the same musical notes and tune you newly created. Now this is something i have copied from you and that is something not my invention. To protect cases of this kind you need copyright
[14:19] <NikitaK3> Question already answered. Thanks!
[14:19] <anwesha> next
[14:19] <deepika_> how do we create copyright license , what if our code matches with someone a bit which i am not aware of, does it violate the law?
[14:19] <ahole[m]> Didn't get the code poet part? How is copyright which is applied to literature applicable to something like code? Literature is art and code is science right? <eom>
[14:21] <theoaradoxer02_> skarpy: do we need to take  written permission?
[14:21] <anwesha> ahole[m], the last situation is a matter of fact not a matter of law.
[14:21] <skarpy> ahole[m]: like everyone has a different way of singing a song, using various tunes, with different instruments, people code differently using different language
[14:21] <kushal> People stop doing cross-talk.
[14:21] <skarpy> theoaradoxer02_: dont know the procedure, but yes, something like that.
[14:22] <anwesha> deepika I hope you will get your answer in the further
[14:23] <deepika_> anwesha okay ,eagerly waiting :)<eom>
[14:24] <anwesha> ahole[m], how come you are sure that code is Science?
[14:25] <anwesha> ahole[m], between when you are writing a book, it is the application of your mind, you are creating something
[14:27] <anwesha> ahole[m], Similarly for a particular coding problem I may use 'for loop' to solve and you may choose "while" loop, it is our personal choice and expression.
[14:27] <anwesha> ahole[m], I guess that answers your question.
[14:27] <anwesha> next
[14:27] <balaji> Is any organization has a data or record of who owns the project ? And Who will Issue the License for the projects?
[14:29] <ahole[m]> anwesha: Art is something that is can't be measured or proved where as science is something that is based on facts and finding and can be quantified. I do agree to the point that we use our creativity in both cases but you can measure code where as art can't be measured. I can decide a price for an app or a script but can we quote the pirce of monalisa.
[14:30] <anwesha> balaji, You (the creator of project) are the person who issues the license. If you want register there is Government department
[14:31] <ahole[m]> s/pirce/price
[14:31] <kushal> ahole[m], That line does not any sense to me.
[14:32] <bhavin192> ahole[m], but how can you decide price of my work, my creativity ?
[14:33] <anwesha> ahole[m], measuring in terms of money does not make any sense. Money can not define Science or Art. For an "app'" you are paying the price the creator has quoted
[14:33] <ikshitij> I agree with kushal. ahole[m] why can't we quote the price of Monalisa. And How can you decide a price for an app ?
[14:33] <anwesha> next
[14:33] <ahole[m]> Mona Lisa (the sand women who never smiled painting)  kushal
[14:33] <samridhia> got answer thanks!
[14:33] <anwesha> next
[14:33] <adas0496> anwesha: what is the time period for which we get a copyright automatically, for software products?
[14:34] <ikshitij> ahole[m]: Price is always quoted by creator not buyer or user.
[14:35] <anwesha> adas0496,  Generally for 20 years (after the demise of the creator) in most of the countries. In US it is 70 years(after the demise of the creator) .
[14:35] <anwesha> next
[14:35] <Phi_mb> You mean I can sell/use anyone copyright legally unless the owner takes me to the court? Based on the skarpy question. <eom>
[14:36] <adas0496> anwesha: okay
[14:36] <ahole[m]> Okay! Now I am confused.
[14:37] <skarpy> Phi_mb: you cant without the consent, and if you do, its stealing which is wrong.
[14:37] <jasonbraganza> ahole[m] / ikshitij  - figure it out after class
[14:38] <anwesha> Phi_mb, yes illegally you can do anything you want, even stealing Tony Stark's suit.
[14:38] <anwesha> next
[14:38] <anuGupta> Answered.<eof>
[14:38] <anwesha> next
[14:38] <anwesha> Continuing
[14:40] <anwesha> We had so many questions about software license
[14:40] <anwesha> What actually is license?
[14:40] <anwesha> Lets take a real life analogy
[14:40] <anwesha> what does a driving license do?
[14:40] <anwesha> It gives you the permission to drive.
[14:40] <anwesha> Similarly a software license also gives you the permission to do certain things with the software.
[14:41] <anwesha> In case of driving license the motor vehicle authority and for the software license the owner of the software gives you the permission.
[14:41] <anwesha> The motor vehicle authority is empowered by the govt to issue driving license but here the owner gets his authority under one of the legal regimes governing intellectual sphere called copyright.
[14:41] <anwesha> The formal definition of the software license is
[14:41] <anwesha> It a legal instrument
[14:41] <anwesha> controlling, deciding, governing
[14:41] <anwesha> the usage,
[14:42] <anwesha> distribution,
[14:42] <anwesha> re-distribution of the
[14:42] <anwesha> software, i.e the subject matter of the license agreement.
[14:42] <anwesha> It is usually made according to, by the way of contract law.
[14:42] <anwesha> Types of software licenses
[14:43] <anwesha> Proprietary License
[14:43] <anwesha> The software which uses  Proprietary Licenses, gives less, limited and restricted rights to the users.
[14:44] <anwesha> The publisher of the software or sometimes any other person/authority retains the source code,
[14:44] <anwesha> User does not have any access to the source code.
[14:44] <anwesha> Users have all their rights drafted in the End Users License Agreement, EULA.
[14:44] <anwesha> It is usually made for a limited period of time.
[14:45] <anwesha> The user may agree to this contract
[14:45] <anwesha> a. in writing,
[14:45] <anwesha> b. interactively on screen
[14:45] <anwesha> or, c. by opening the box containing the software (shrink wrap licensing).
[14:45] <anwesha> Most of the gaming software uses this kind of commercial licensing (shrink wrap licensing).
[14:46] <anwesha> Any question so far?
[14:46] <anwesha> Continuing
[14:46] <ashwanig> !
[14:46] <anwesha> next
[14:47] <ashwanig> When installing games or other software it asks for accept license, do they not use shrink wrap licensing?
[14:47] <ashwanig> <eof>
[14:47] <skarpy> !
[14:50] <anwesha> ashwanig, no it is not. When you are opening up a DVD of Game you are entering into a Contract. Where you are clicking something on the screen it is not Shrink Wrap licensing.
[14:50] <anwesha> next
[14:50] <skarpy> so the shrink wrap licensing which we normally see, while installing any game or software, is actually EULA? which tells us the limits/rights we can have?
[14:51] <anwesha> skarpy, yes
[14:52] <skarpy> ok, thanks. <eom>
[14:52] <anwesha> skarpy, as the person who is using the game is the end user of the product.
[14:52] <anwesha> continuing
[14:52] <anwesha> If the Commercial Proprietary Licenses are on one side of the pole, Public Domain stands on the other extreme.
[14:53] <anwesha> The word Domain means field, land.
[14:53] <anwesha> Therefore we may construe that the works which are in Public Domain as
[14:53] <anwesha> Something there at the public territory for the use of the Public at large.
[14:54] <anwesha> All the I.P rights of the developer are relinquished, waived in case of Public Domain.
[14:54] <anwesha> There are actually 3 ways by which a work can be subjected to Public Domain:
[14:54] <anwesha> Software whose exclusive intellectual property rights have
[14:54] <anwesha> 1. expired,
[14:54] <anwesha> 2. to which intellectual property rights are inapplicable.
[14:54] <anwesha> 3. waived.
[14:55] <anwesha> If you want to subject your work into public domain you have to specifically dedicate it to the same.
[14:57] <anwesha> You have to include a license file in project source, copyright notice in the important (quality and quantity both) source code files.
[14:57] <anwesha> This is how you dedicate your project to a particular license.
[14:58] <anwesha>  In case of a Public Domain dedication you have to write it as in those abovemenioned places.
[14:58] <anwesha> Not writing anything as your license does not place your work into public domain.
[14:59] <anwesha> In this case no one will be able to use your code.
[15:00] <anwesha> Not having a proper license means that you are giving me nice plate of food and not saying what to do with it.
[15:00] <anwesha> Should eat it?
[15:00] <anwesha> Throw it?
[15:01] <anwesha> or am I not suppose to touch it at all.
[15:02] <anwesha> But we have to remember and understand Public Domain is not similar to licensing.
[15:03] <anwesha> Here you are giving up all your intellectual property right what soever.
[15:04] <anwesha> Dedication of a software to Public Domain?
[15:04] <anwesha>  Writing it as Public Domain
[15:04] <anwesha> Opting for Creative Commons 0
[15:05] <anwesha> There are countries where dedication into Public Domain is not possible.
[15:05] <anwesha> Creative Commons have been innovated/ drafted  to make a provision for dedication into public domain  in countries, where public domain is not possible.
[15:05] <anwesha> Any question so far
[15:05] <anwesha> *?
[15:05] <skarpy> !
[15:05] <anwesha> next
[15:05] <skarpy> what is creative commons?
[15:06] <anwesha> skarpy, the link will be provided after the session.
[15:06] <skarpy> ok.
[15:06] <anwesha> continuing
[15:07] <anwesha> We have covered the two extreme ends.
[15:07] <anwesha> Now there is another way which stays in the middle.
[15:07] <anwesha> Which is beneficial both for the creator, originator and the user
[15:07] <anwesha> Open Source
[15:07] <anwesha> Under Open Source software license the following rights are grated regarding the software:
[15:08] <anwesha> a. source code is made accessible (sometimes upon requests based on the terms of the license), along with the further rights to:
[15:08] <anwesha> b. study,
[15:08] <anwesha> c. change,
[15:08] <anwesha> d. distribute,
[15:08] <anwesha> e. re-distribute,
[15:08] <anwesha> the software to anyone for any reason.
[15:08] <anwesha> Wikipedia says -" Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose."
[15:09] <anwesha> Open Source gives  the common platform to work and make a better software with collaborative effort knowledge.
[15:09] <anwesha> OSI, the Open Source Initiative jots down 10 promises which an Open Source License makes:
[15:09] <anwesha> 1. Free Redistribution
[15:09] <anwesha> 2. The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form.
[15:09] <anwesha> 3. The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.
[15:09] <anwesha> 4.Integrity of The Author's Source Code: This promise saves the author from any liability caused due to the mistake of the other contributor.
[15:09] <anwesha> 5. The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.
[15:10] <anwesha> 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
[15:10] <anwesha> 7. The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.
[15:10] <anwesha> 8.License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
[15:10] <anwesha> 9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
[15:10] <anwesha> 10. No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
[15:11] <anwesha> Examples: MIT, BSD, Apache are some examples of Open Source Licenses.
[15:11] <anwesha> Free software:
[15:11] <anwesha> We have to understand Free Software in a broader context.
[15:11] <anwesha> Free Software is movement, revolution.
[15:11] <anwesha>  It is the first organized battle in the liberation of cyber space.
[15:12] <anwesha> The battle to control, regulate your own computer (who controls your machine is it a big company or you?).
[15:12] <anwesha> Is it the program that is controlling you, the users or is it the users who are controlling the  program, computer?
[15:12] <anwesha> The question was answered by the innovation of the following four freedoms:
[15:12] <anwesha> Four Freedoms
[15:13] <anwesha> The word free in free software stands for freedom for users
[15:13] <anwesha> Not as free as buy one get one free.
[15:14] <anwesha> Not as free as in no money, without any monitory exchange.
[15:14] <anwesha> There are 4 core freedoms that make the free software.
[15:15] <anwesha> Lets consider your software to be a sandwich can use the as you want you can eat it, distribute it, through it, play with it whatever you wish to do.
[15:15] <anwesha> (freedom 1) Ensures the freedom to modify the source code.
[15:15] <anwesha> This freedom says that you are not only getting sandwich but also the recipe along with the freedom to do the modifications as per your choice.
[15:15] <anwesha>  So you can make your own sandwich. Ohh I don't like the cheese here goes out the cheese.
[15:15] <anwesha>  I love bacon here goes the bacon in it. So you are getting the software + source code+the right of modification
[15:15] <anwesha> (freedom 2) The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
[15:16] <anwesha> So, you are free to distribute the software along with these four freedoms to your friend and to the world at large for the matter of the fact.
[15:16] <anwesha> (freedom 3) The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others .
[15:16] <anwesha> The sandwich you made, can distribute it with the new add to recipe to your friends.
[15:16] <anwesha> The major distinction between sandwich and software is that once you give your pizza to someone you don't have one but in software you.These duties are the originator of GNU General Pubic License.
[15:16] <anwesha> Examples Gnu GPL, LGPL etc.
[15:17] <anwesha> With this we have come to the session today.
[15:17] <anwesha>  * end of the session
[15:18] <avik> !
[15:18] <im_mohsin> !
[15:18] <anwesha> I will take another sessions about the licenses and the best practices.
[15:18] <anuGupta> !
[15:18] <skarpy> wonderful session anwesha :)
[15:18] <anwesha> So questions
[15:18] <anwesha> skarpy, thanks
[15:18] <anwesha> next
[15:18] <avik> if I can distribute copies, how to satisfy the money the developer had planned?
[15:19] <priyansh> Learned a lot today. Thanks anwesha :)
[15:19] <anwesha> avik, can you rephrase it?
[15:19] <avik> if i start editing and shareing, why will anyone buy it?
[15:20] <championshuttler> !
[15:20] <avik> because Free did not mean free of money right?
[15:20] <avik> <eom>
[15:21] <kushal> avik, tell the full story, is this your code? or you took someone's else's code?
[15:21] <anwesha> avik, I guess you are worried about the commercial as aspect of free software
[15:21] <anwesha> right?
[15:22] <avik> kushal, lets say you developed a code! A Free and open sourced!
[15:22] <avik> I edit it
[15:22] <avik> and now I have the right to distribute it
[15:22] <avik> say i give it to anwesha
[15:22] <kushal> avik, People pay for service, not for the code.
[15:22] <avik> so, anwesha did not had to buy it from you
[15:23] <avik> kushal, got that!
[15:23] <kushal> avik, So people will still pay me to get any help than you, because you may not know everything about the code.
[15:23] <ikshitij> !
[15:23] <avik> but what does distribute mean here?
[15:23] <anwesha> people actually have different marketing and business policy for it
[15:23] <avik> <eom>
[15:23] <anwesha> next
[15:23] <im_mohsin> How does licensing helps in open source? People can share distribute,redistribute and modify to any extent or it exist to acknowledge the original creator?
[15:23] <kushal> avik, give to someone.
[15:23] <deepika_> !
[15:24] <avik> kushal, give the code, not the full service, is that it?
[15:24] <kushal> avik, wait, I will explain after the session.
[15:24] <avik> ok!
[15:24] <soumam_> bhgeyfgfyrf
[15:24] <soumam_> oops sorry
[15:25] <anwesha> im_mohsin, please go through the whole session. For now which license you choose decides the path for your project.
[15:25] <anwesha> next
[15:25] <anuGupta> When I make changes in the software ,is it changed globally?<eof>
[15:26] <anwesha> anuGupta, no the change happens only to your software.
[15:26] <anuGupta> And then we can distribute it to someone we wish to share with?
[15:27] <anwesha> anuGupta, if you add salt to your food that does not make my food salty, similar analogy.
[15:27] <anwesha> next
[15:27] <championshuttler> what if i sell a open source software providing i am not owner of it?
[15:28] <avik> kushal, I guess most of us are stuck at the distribution part!
[15:29] <avik> anwesha, ^^
[15:29] <anwesha> championshuttler, based on the license the upstream chose, decides if you can sell it or not.
[15:29] <kushal> avik, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)
[15:30] <kushal> avik, For tl;dr https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/distribution
[15:30] <anwesha> championshuttler, most of the operating systems companies do that
[15:30] <anwesha> next
[15:30] <ikshitij> Suppose we made a software open source. We are working in community writing code from scratch.
[15:30] <adas0496> !
[15:30] <avik> ok!
[15:30] <ikshitij>  How can we ensure that someone (within the community or outside the community) can't use that for commercial purpose with little bit modification and later claiming developed by that person himself or herself
[15:30] <skat_sd> !
[15:31] <ikshitij> As he knows Everything about software
[15:32] <anwesha> ikshitij, it is a matter of fact, anyways you have version control systems for that.
[15:32] <anwesha> next
[15:32] <deepika_> Thanks anwesha , it was great to get an idea copyright!
[15:32] <deepika_> What are these places to which intellectual property rights are inapplicable ?
[15:32] <soumam_> !
[15:33] <soumam_> anwesha i am having problem with those tricky words of license, i cant understand the points. what shall i do?
[15:33] <anwesha> deepika_ no countries as far as my knowledge goes
[15:33] <anwesha> next
[15:33] <samridhia> sorry have to leave early! thanks for the great session anwesha.
[15:33] <soumam_> sorry :(
[15:33] <adas0496> if I don't explicitely include a licence with my software product,
[15:34] <anwesha> next
[15:34] <adas0496> does that implies I have complete copyright and others are not allowed to use it without my permission?
[15:34] <soumam_> anwesha i am having problem with those tricky words of license, i cant understand the points. what shall i do?
[15:34] <adas0496> <eof>
[15:34] <skarpy> !
[15:34] <skat_sd> Suppose i have a system software(linux distro) licensed under GPL. Suddenly i decide i do not want to give out the source code for some reason(think Windows). Now many people have already downloaded the system software before this decision and they can see the code. Can i revert back to not giving source code? if yes, what would happen to the people who already have the source code?
[15:34] <anwesha> soumam_ we will be there in the channel to help you :)
[15:34] <anwesha> next
[15:34] <soumam_> ok anwesha :)
[15:35] <anwesha> next
[15:35] <skarpy> the links to follow?
[15:35] <anwesha> skarpy, later
[15:35] <skarpy> ok
[15:36] <anwesha> skat_sd, sorry I missed your question
[15:36] <adas0496> anwesha: mine too
[15:37] <skat_sd> anwesha, no problem, you can answer in your own time.
[15:37] <anwesha> skat_sd, the answer is no, the earlier version will be GPL, you can change the license in the next version.
[15:38] <skat_sd> okay, thanks
[15:38] <anwesha> adas0496, can you ask once again
[15:38] <adas0496> if I don't explicitely include a licence with my software product,
[15:38] <adas0496> does that implies I have complete copyright and others are not allowed to use it without my permission?
[15:42] <anwesha> adas0496, yes but please understand other than public domain you have copyright  in all case and fact. By licensing you are actually telling what/how other people  can use it.
[15:42] <anwesha> next
[15:43] <adas0496> anwesha: thanks. looking forward to next session
[15:44] <anwesha> I saw a comment at the initiation of the session that how come I have dual degree. I am a lawyer (masters of law), I don't have any Computer Science or Engineering  degree.
[15:44] <anwesha> kushal, back to you.
[15:44] <kushal> https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2014/vanl.log is a log from VanL about Creative Commons.

[13:55] <kushal> rkased, It is a text file
[13:55] <rkased> okay
[13:55] <kushal> rkased, less ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[13:56] <kushal> rkased, don't use vim, you may destroy the file by mistake
[13:56] <kushal> next
[13:56] <rkased> Cool, thanks
[13:56] <yurii_> it looks like i missed  creating ssh kay
[13:56] <ashwanig> !

[13:56] <kushal> yurii_, do the first 4 steps from https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/
[13:56] <yurii_> i was disconected
[13:56] <kushal> next
[13:56] <yurii_> ok
[13:56] <apoorv> it says no such file or directory?
[13:57] <kushal> apoorv, what says?
[13:57] <apoorv> when i run the command ls -la /.ssh
[13:57] <apoorv> ls: cannot access '/.shh': No such file or directory
[13:57] <kushal> apoorv, correct
[13:57] <jasonbraganza> apoorv ~/.ssh
[13:57] <kushal> apoorv, read the command I gave.
[13:57] <kushal> and then type
[13:58] <kushal> This is why learning to type is so important.
[13:58] <apoorv> ohh okay
[13:58] <kushal> You all should spend time in that.
[13:58] <rkased> !
[13:58] <kushal> next
[13:58] <samridhia> After typing that command i can see "total 20" so what does that mean?
[13:58] <kshitij> apoorv, command is wrong
[13:58] <kushal> samridhia, can you please show me the command you just now typed?
[13:59] <samridhia> ls -la ~/.ssh
[14:00] <apoorv> ya kushal i got it
[14:00] <samridhia> It is showing both the files you said but also some more files of previous dates. Does that mean i have used ssh key previously also?
[14:00] <kushal> samridhia, it may shows known_hosts file
[14:00] <kushal> and a config file
[14:00] <yurii_> done
[14:00] <deepika__> !
[14:01] <kushal> next
[14:01] <samridhia> yes kushal it is showing known_hosts file
[14:01] <ashwanig> should I open both the files to see the content?<eom>
[14:01] <kushal> samikshan, no issues, we will explain that in some time
[14:01] <kushal> ashwanig, if you want to :)
[14:01] <kushal> next
[14:02] <skarpy> !
[14:02] <ashwanig> kushal, But you said opening in vim will destroy it?
[14:02] <CHOCOS> !
[14:02] <kushal> ashwanig, yes, by accident
[14:02] <kushal> ashwanig, and then I also showed you the less command.
[14:02] <jasonbraganza> ashwanig use less just to be sure
[14:02] <kushal> ashwanig, Do you know about the less command?
[14:02] <ikshitij> kushal: it is showing 3 files in my machine ! known_hosts, id_rsa, id_rsa.pub . Is this ok ?
[14:02] <kushal> ikshitij, yes
[14:02] <ashwanig> kushal, no
[14:03] <rkased> Two part question, one: once I get to view my private key, how do I return to the normal terminal command prompt window. Second: What if I don't use this computer in the future how do I protect my private key from other users from accessing it?
[14:03] <kushal> ashwanig, time to learn :)
[14:03] <kushal> rkased, press q
[14:03] <rkased> NIce
[14:03] <kushal> rkased, you can not, you are only supposed to do that in your private computer.
[14:03] <rkased> I didn't want to take any chance
[14:03] <soumam_> !
[14:03] <rkased> I see
[14:03] <kushal> rkased, that is good :)
[14:03] <ikshitij> ashwanig: http://lym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[14:03] <kushal> ikshitij, :)
[14:03] <kushal> next
[14:04] <deepika__> kushal what if the file got damaged ,can we create and replace with a new one ?
[14:04] <rkased> !
[14:04] <kushal> deepika__, Yes, but better you take care of the file
[14:04] <kushal> deepika__, We use these keys to login to remote computers, so you don't have any way to readd the new key, you will be in trouble.
[14:04] <kushal> next
[14:04] <skarpy> kushal: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/BcsmVXpN-9jII4IdTY19Gg this are the files showing, what does those mean?
[14:05] <skarpy> and what are those allocations? 4096,3326 ..
[14:05] <neer1> !
[14:05] <kushal> skarpy, This means 2 things.
[14:05] <samridhia> skarpy, that's what i got as an output
[14:06] <kushal> skarpy, 1. You will have to learn about ls command
[14:06] <kushal> 2. You never read what I said for the output of the ls command
[14:06] <kushal> next
[14:06] <CHOCOS> got my answer :)
[14:06] <kushal> skarpy, also you skipped lym book,
[14:06] <kushal> next
[14:06] <soumam_> though i have total 32 i cannot seen any mention of known host files :(
[14:07] <jasonbraganza> soumam_ - donât worry about it
[14:08] <championshuttler> !
[14:09] <Phi_mb> !
[14:09] <kushal> Do anyone knows what is total?
[14:10] <soumam__> i dont know, i thought no. of files
[14:10] <kvy_> I also don't know.
[14:10] <kushal> total number of 1024 bytes blocks
[14:10] <kushal> not the total number of files
[14:10] <rkased> wow
[14:10] <soumam__> ohk
[14:11] <kushal> or maybe 512 according to the POSIX standard
[14:11] <bhavin192> soumam__, may I know what is ohk?
[14:11] <poojaencoded> Roll:pooja kumari singh
[14:12] <soumam__> bhavin s/ohk/ok :)
[14:12] <ashwanig> kushal, So that means number of kilobytes?

[14:12] <bhavin192> ashwanig, No
[14:12] <kushal> ashwanig, no, blocks in the filesystem

[14:12] <rkased> What is the importance and purpose of a ssh key?, Also, what if the computer that the ssh key was created on is damaged or inaccessible?
[14:12] <kushal> rkased, you have to take a secured backup
[14:13] <EdIhCePs> !
[14:13] <soumam__> !
[14:13] <kushal> Now, you all have github account, you can add your key (the public one) there

[14:18] <neer1> I added the ssh key to github account but the password still works how do I use it.<eom>
[14:18] <kushal> neer1, you will have to update the remote (in the .git/config) file to use the git@... format url
[14:18] <kushal> neer1, search about it in the github
[14:18] <kushal> next
[14:19] <kushal> next
[14:19] <Phi_mb> 1. What if our private key is compromised, can we change it? 2.If configuring ssh allows me to access remote computer without prompting for passwords, What if someone gets physical access to my system, he can access my remote server? <eom>
[14:20] <kushal> Phi_mb, 1. yes, create a new key, change the public key every where
[14:21] <kushal> 2. Yes, that is why I asked to give a long passphrase
[14:21] <Phi_mb> Ok, thanks.
[14:21] <kushal> Phi_mb, in future we will talk about disk encryption
[14:21] <kushal> next

[14:22] <kushal> Phi_mb, Yes, always the first thing to do
[14:22] <kushal> next
[14:22] <soumam__> kushal why did we do that ? was it a password? if it was a password then the for whom was it for ? any particular file ?
[14:22] <kushal> soumam__, do what?
[14:22] <soumam__> adding ssh keys
[14:22] <kushal> soumam__, have you read any of the links provided today?
[14:23] <kushal> soumam__, start reading the links please
[14:23] <soumam__> wikipedi going through
[14:23] <kushal> next
[14:23] <soumam__> ok
[14:23] <championshuttler> !
[14:23] <rkased> In this case, our ssh-agent is github? Also, a random question, does bot name batul have a meaning?
[14:23] <kushal> rkased, nope, ssh-agent runs on your computer.
[14:23] <kushal> You are using the key to connect to github.
[14:24] <omair_kh> !
[14:24] <kushal> rkased, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantul_the_Great
[14:24] <rkased> Thank you
[14:24] <kushal> next
[14:24] <championshuttler> is it totally secure? because as per wikipedia it decrypted by US agency
[14:25] <ashwanig> !
[14:25] <kushal> championshuttler, Then you know the answer.
[14:25] <Phi_mb> championshuttler, nothing is totally safe. You have to cautious. :)
[14:25] <Phi_mb> s/to/to be
[14:25] <kushal> championshuttler, It is secured from your college friends.
[14:25] <championshuttler> kushal: ok :)
[14:25] <kushal> next
[14:26] <omair_kh> Can i change the passphrase of my key i just created
[14:26] <rkased> Phi_mb what does s/to/to be mean?
[14:26] <Phi_mb> s/to/"to be"
[14:26] <kushal> omair_kh, Yes
[14:26] <championshuttler> rkased: its means s/old/new
[14:26] <omair_kh> how ?
[14:27] <kushal> omair_kh, https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases/
[14:27] <kushal> omair_kh, You know you can search too.
[14:27] <kushal> You don't have to pay anyone for searching :)
[14:27] <kushal> next
[14:27] <ashwanig> By adding the SSH key we are telling github that anything coming from this computer is from the user right? <eom>
[14:27] <omair_kh> Thanks
[14:27] <kushal> ashwanig, no, we are using that to authenticate
[14:28] <kushal> a different way than password
[14:28] <kushal> username/password
[14:28] <kushal> ashwanig, read the wikipedia page please
[14:28] <kushal> next
[14:28] <Phi_mb> kushal, using ssh will help us to secure our push to github, so that no one can intercept it?  Just confirming if I understood it correctly.
[14:29] <kushal> Phi_mb, it will simply help you to identify you in a better way.
[14:29] <kushal> Phi_mb, say I may know your passphrase
[14:30] <kushal> but I will still need that id_rsa file to do anything in your github
[14:30] <Phi_mb> Ok, like two way authentication. :)
[14:30] <kushal> Phi_mb, but for username/password combination
[14:30] <kushal> that is different
[14:30] <kushal> Phi_mb, please read the wikipedia page first
[14:30] <Vamsi3296> !
[14:31] <kushal> next
[14:31] <skat-sd> !
[14:31] <Vamsi3296> What is github_rsa.pub for?
[14:31] <Phi_mb> Ok, I will continue my doubts, if any still remain after the session after completing the wikipedia page.
[14:31] <Vamsi3296> if we have id_rsa.pub.<eof>
[14:31] <kushal> Phi_mb, you can search and also ask
[14:32] <kushal> Vamsi3296, it the public part of your key
[14:32] <kushal> Vamsi3296, Phi_mb https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-ssh-encryption-and-connection-process
[14:33] <Vamsi3296> if you want to do anything with my github, does github_rsa.pub works?
[14:33] <Vamsi3296> @kushal
[14:33] <Vamsi3296> <eof>
[14:34] <rkased> !
[14:34] <kushal> Vamsi3296, nope, it is public information.
[14:34] <kushal> Vamsi3296, what is your github username?
[14:35] <Vamsi3296> kushal: vamsi3296@github.com
[14:35] <kushal> Vamsi3296, I can see you have added two keys
[14:35] <kushal> https://github.com/vamsi3296.keys
[14:35] <kushal> Vamsi3296, now you know how find any github user's public key
[14:36] <kushal> https://github.com/kushaldas.keys is mine
[14:36] <kushal> next
[14:36] <Vamsi3296> yes.Thank you @kushal
[14:36] <skat-sd> got my answer
[14:37] <ikshitij> https://github.com/iKshitiz.keys kushal check mine if that's ok
[14:38] <kushal> ikshitij, you try to use it, if it works, then it is okay
[14:38] <kushal> next
[14:38] <rkased> When I wanted to install xclip using sudo apt-get command, I got a prompt "unable to resolve host", then I was prompted to enter my password. Is there a more efficient way to avoid that unable to resolve host part?
[14:38] <kushal> rkased, I think  that has something to do with ubuntu
[14:38] <kushal> rkased, search how to solve it.
[14:38] <rkased> Okay
[14:38] <kushal> I don't have that in Fedora
[14:38] <kushal> next
[14:38] <kushal> rkased, also means I don't know.
[14:39] <rkased> haha, thanks
[14:39] <ikshitij> rkased: better use any text editor ! xclip just copy text to clip board
[14:39] <kushal> rkased, you can just use less command
[14:39] <kushal> and then select and copy
[14:39] <rkased> okay
[14:40] <Phi_mb> rkased, I think it's something with the permissions. Check using ls-l.
[14:41] <kushal> next
[14:41] <rkased> !
[14:42] <rkased> nevermind
[14:43] <kushal> next
[14:44] <rkased> nevermind
[14:44] <soumam__> !
[14:45] <kushal> next
[14:45] <soumam__> will the length of the key (string) vary with different passphrase?or the length remains same?
[14:46] <kushal> soumam__, try
[14:46] <kushal> and see yourself
[14:46] <soumam__> ok :)
[14:47] <kvy_> !
[14:47] <ikshitij> soumam__: share with us also :)
[14:47] <apoorv> !
[14:48] <soumam__> kushal its saying that will it over write or not ? but i want the previous one to also remain
[14:48] <kushal> soumam__, copy the previous one to some place first
[14:49] <kushal> and then try
[14:49] <kushal> next
[14:49] <kvy_> $ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[14:49] <kvy_> is not working
[14:49] <kvy_> <eof>
[14:49] <soumam__> ok
[14:49] <kvy_> it show bash: /home/vipin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: No such file or directory
[14:50] <kushal> kvy_, Have you created the key as in the first step of today's session?
[14:51] <kvy_> yes
[14:52] <Phi_mb> kvy_, You haven't added to your agent.  Maybe.
[14:52] <Vamsi3296> kvy_: try this $xclip -i < !/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[14:52] <Vamsi3296> s/!/~
[14:53] <skarpy> kvy: check this: ls -la ~/.ssh , if you are getting something, the key is generated, next check if you added to ssh agent.

[14:56] <bhavin192> kvy_, wow! thank you for flooding :)
[14:56] <Phi_mb> bhavin192, I don't know, I missed the starting of the lecture.
[14:56] <soumam007> ikshitij, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/xTC-fJMjorVjfHsh8VKrWw for you :0
[14:56] <soumam007> s/:0/:) hehe
[14:57] <ghishadow> kvy_, remove $ just type `xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` it will copy to your clipboard
[14:57] <bhavin192> Phi_mb, you confused me as well.
[14:57] <bhavin192> xD
[14:57] <Phi_mb> :D
[14:58] <ashwanig> ghishadow, :P
[14:58] <kushal> kvy_, does not have any keys as I can see
[14:58] <kushal> next
[14:58] <kvy_> ghishadow i already removed that symbol ($)
[14:58] <jasonbraganza> if youâre reading Kushalâs Digital Ocean article - this yt video explains the confusing encryption part well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do
[14:58] <skarpy> bhavin192: no we are not instructed to add to agent. At least i didn't saw it
[14:58] <kushal> skarpy, correct
[14:58] <kushal> skarpy, thanks for following
[14:59] <bhavin192> skarpy, yup, I was trying to imagine how that can confuse someone who is completely new to this
[15:00] <rkased> !
[15:00] <kushal> next
[15:00] <soumam007> kushal keys are always different even if the passphrase is same but length of key remains constant irrespective of the size of passphrase :)
[15:00] <apoorv> ping
[15:01] <anuGupta> !
[15:01] <rkased> I believe some time ago I created an ssh on a different machine, how can I recover it?
[15:01] <kushal> soumam007, Now you know something
[15:01] <soumam007> yup
[15:01] <apoorv> sorry i got disconnected . it my turn over?
[15:01] <rkased> Also, if I change OS on a computer, the ssh key still remains on the harddrive?
[15:01] <apoorv> it/is
[15:01] <apoorv> !
[15:02] <rkased> apoorv what is the purpose of the forward slash in your comment?
[15:02] <kushal> apoorv, ask
[15:02] <kushal> next
[15:02] <kushal> next
[15:02] <apoorv> when ssh utilises Asymmetrical Encryption why does is also use Symmetrical Encryption. I mean we can encrypt the data with asymmetrical and send it to client then to generate a shared secret key ? <eof>
[15:02] <rkased> !
[15:02] <anuGupta> It seems I have forgotten my passphrase.So I need to create another by deleting the first one?<eof>
[15:03] <ikshitij> Thanks soumam007 ! Now we can answer someone having same question
[15:03] <soumam007> yes :P
[15:03] <skarpy> anuGupta: simply generate a new one. :)
[15:03] <soumam007> anuGupta, just overwrite it :)
[15:03] <anuGupta> Ok
[15:03] <ikshitij> anuGupta: Overwrite old one ! Just repeat the steps !
[15:03] <kushal> next
[15:04] <Phi_mb> jasonbraganza, Thanks, that video cleared my doubts. :)
[15:04] <rkased> Also, if I change OS on a computer, the ssh key still remains on the harddrive? I believe some time ago I created an ssh on a different machine, how can I recover it?
[15:04] <apoorv> kushal you did not answer my question?
[15:05] <kushal> apoorv, ssh is not for encrypting data the way you want, we use gpg
[15:05] <kushal> for that.
[15:05] <kushal> We will learn about it in future
[15:05] <kushal> next
[15:05] <apoorv> okay
[15:05] <kushal> rkased, copy it from there
[15:06] <rkased> okay
[15:07] <soumam007> !
[15:08] <im_mohsin>  kushal if i do shh-copy-id <github_account_id>, it does the same thing as we did manually to setup ssh key in github?
[15:08] <kushal> im_mohsin, I don't think so
[15:08] <kushal> next
[15:08] <soumam007> if i created all these keys in my host machine ,will my vm also be able to detect these keys?
[15:08] <kushal> soumam007, no
[15:08] <soumam007> ok thanks
[15:09] <rkased> soumam007, what's vm?
[15:09] <soumam007> rkased, virtual machine
[15:10] <kushal> next
[15:10] <kushal> sayan, you want to take over?
[15:11] <im_mohsin> kushal, i watching a ssh related video and it used a this command setup ssh in remote server
[15:11] <rkased> !
[15:11] <im_mohsin> s/this/this to
[15:13] <kushal> im_mohsin, correct, but you don't have access to github servers.
[15:13] <kushal> im_mohsin, It is a web service you are using
[15:15] <sayan> kushal: I don't know where you left off
[15:15] <sayan> kushal: all the uploading things after done?
[15:18] <soumam007> sayan we have added our keys to our github a/c
[15:18] <kushal> sayan, I just talked about ssh
[15:18] <kushal> next
[15:18] <rkased> What does gpg mean? You mentioned it earlier.
[15:19] <sayan> rkased: googled?
[15:20] <sayan> rkased: it is a key used for encrypting stuffs
[15:20] <kushal> sayan, no, he just used the force.
[15:20] <rkased> okay, I wanted to google, but didn't have any key words or additional context.
[15:20] <rkased> That sounds good, thanks.
[15:20] <sayan> rkased: what is gpg key
[15:21] <kushal> rkased, Why my force is not that strong?
[15:21] <sayan> next
[15:22] <rkased> I'm not sure what you are asking?
[15:22] <kushal> rkased, we will explain later.
[15:22] <rkased> sayan - "GPG key to use for signing commits and tags." https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/
[15:22] <rkased> okay
[15:23] <sayan> Now people go to this repo: https://github.com/dgplug/dgplug10
[15:23] <sayan> and clone the repo using ssh
[15:23] <sayan> s/ssh/ssh urls/
[15:25] <jasonbraganza> is slow. happening
[15:25] <ashwanig> sayan, It asks for password
[15:25] <rkased> yes
[15:25] <rkased> should I download the zip after choosing use ssh?
[15:25] <bhavin192> I get this, The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.253.113)' can't be established.
[15:25] <rkased> !
[15:25] <sayan> ashwanig: yes, your ssh key password
[15:26] <sayan> next
[15:26] <rkased> should I download the zip after choosing use ssh?
[15:26] <sayan> rkased: no clone
[15:26] <rkased> okay

[15:32] <balaji> sayan, How ssh differs from actual cloning?
[15:32] <soumam_> !
[15:32] <sayan> ssh is a protocol
[15:32] <Phi_mb> !
[15:32] <sayan> using which you connect to the server

[15:34] <skarpy> ikshitij: you too?
[15:34] <ikshitij> Sorry Sayan !
[15:35] <sayan> soumam_: did you add your ssh keys to Github?
[15:35] <soumam_> yes sayan
[15:35] <soumam_> but i overwrote it but not added again
[15:35] <ashwanig> !
[15:35] <soumam_> will it be an issue
[15:35] <soumam_> ?
[15:35] <Vamsi3296> yes.
[15:35] <sayan> soumam_: if the public key is not same, yes
[15:35] <sayan> next
[15:35] <Phi_mb> Why the link for ssh cloning becomes available only after login? <eom>
[15:36] <ikshitij> skarpy: what you too ? :)
[15:36] <avik> !
[15:36] <soumam_> ok thanks sayan Vamsi3296 :)
[15:36] <yurii> done
[15:37] <sayan> next
[15:37] <neer1> I was authenticated using shell, but it says github doesn't provide shell access, so what kind of client should I use to connect?<eom>
[15:37] <sayan> Phi_mb: I think it is needed for check if ssh key is added
[15:37] <sayan> Phi_mb: not sure thought
[15:37] <sayan> Phi_mb: but how does that matter?
[15:38] <Phi_mb> Just wondering, why. :)
[15:38] <sayan> I have told earlier, "No Just wondering questions"
[15:38] <sayan> next
[15:38] <deepika__> sayan  how can we push commits using ssh ?
[15:38] <Phi_mb> sayan, Ok, will be careful next time.
[15:39] <sayan> neer1: I guess the windows github client it is talk of
[15:39] <sayan> deepika__: the same way you were earlier doing
[15:39] <sayan> the complete process is same
[15:39] <sayan> only the communication protocol changed from https to ssh
[15:39] <sayan> rest is same
[15:39] <sayan> can someone tell me why?
[15:40] <deepika__> sayan and we still need to login in terminal
[15:40] <deepika__> ?
[15:40] <sayan> deepika__: you don't login
[15:40] <anuGupta> !
[15:41] <sayan> because the Git != Github
[15:41] <sayan> all the things you learned earlier was Git
[15:41] <sayan> and to communicate with Github you use https or ssh
[15:41] <sayan> next
[15:41] <ashwanig> Why is it only the first time when cloning it asked for the passphrase? <eof>
[15:41] <deepika__> sayan sorry i forgot to mention GitHub
[15:42] <sayan> ashwanig: I did not get you, you clone once only
[15:42] <ashwanig> sayan, I tried cloning other repo. It didn't ask for passphrase
[15:43] <sayan> ashwanig: oh! ok. the password is cached for sometime
[15:43] <sayan> you can remove, or configure to lesser time
[15:43] <sayan> cached = remembers
[15:43] <sayan> next
[15:43] <avik> sayan, why do you recommend ssh over https?
[15:44] <ashwanig> avik, if you use https, you still need to give username password
[15:44] <skarpy> avik: because more secure, obviously!
[15:44] <avik> ok!
[15:44] <skat--sd> ashwanig, there was a dialog box right after entering the passphrase for the first time that you are giving access to use the passphrase for furthur cloning for a limited time.
[15:45] <ashwanig> skat--sd, Yes, I didn't touch it
[15:45] <sayan> avik:  :)
[15:45] <im_mohsin> sayan, i'm getting this error https://pastebin.com/Njti0Wnb
[15:45] <avik> sayan, :D
[15:45] <skat--sd> ashwanig, by default, it said it gives access for a limited time :-)
[15:45] <sayan> you can trusted computers wihout involving passwords
[15:45] <sayan> next
[15:46] <ashwanig> skat--sd, got it :)
[15:46] <anuGupta> I am facing an error destination path already exists and is not an empty directory<eof>
[15:46] <soumam_> im_mohsin, did you change your passphrase?
[15:46] <im_mohsin> soumam_, No
[15:46] <soumam_> then may be you havent added it properly to github check once
[15:47] <Vamsi3296> im_mohsin: its the public key.Did you change it?
[15:47] <ashwanig> anuGupta, You have a directory named dgplug10, you should delete it first
[15:47] <ashwanig> or clone into somewhere else
[15:47] <anuGupta> Let me delete it then
[15:48] <neer1> I am done, going to have dinner
[15:50] <ikshitij> sayan: what to do next ? I mean after cloning repo 'dgplug10' over ssh
[15:52] <sayan> sorry, had to attend an email
[15:52] <anuGupta> im_mohsin You are giving it wrong after git clone I guess
[15:52] <sayan> anuGupta: you already have that directory in the current directory
[15:52] <sayan> next
[15:52] <sayan> im_mohsin: you need to raise your hands before asking questions
[15:53] <im_mohsin> Oops sorry sayan mistake
[15:54] <skarpy> sayan: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/KMFJ~z3dktkH9wz2f~HAgQ , help a bit.
[15:55] <sayan> people raise your hands

[13:29] <championshuttler> Shivam Singhal
[13:29] <mbuf> I am Shakthi Kannan (@shakthimaan), and I will be introducing you to GNU Emacs today
[13:30] <mbuf> This is not going to be a tutorial
[13:30] <sayan> Sayan Chowdhury
[13:30] <knrai> krishnanand rai
[13:30] <mbuf> Everyone will have their own pace of working with such a setup, and hence, I want to give you an overview of Emacs
[13:31] <Phi_mb> Roll Call: Mohit
[13:31] <mbuf> Emacs is a text editor but it can be extended and customized to your needs
[13:31] <mbuf> It is primarily written in Lisp and C
[13:31] <mbuf> It is one of the oldest text editors. A lot of great software has been written using it
[13:31] <Vamsi3296> Roll call: Vamsi Krishna.
[13:32] <mbuf> A lot of GNU software developers use GNU Emacs
[13:32] <mbuf> Linus Torvalds also uses a variant of Emacs
[13:32] <mbuf> One of the GitHub founders actually used Emacs as well
[13:32] <_RicharD_> Roll call : Mayank gupta
[13:33] <ahole[m]> Kshithij Iyer
[13:33] <mbuf> There are many variants available today such as GNU Emacs, XEmacs, Aqua Emacs, Spacemacs etc.
[13:33] <priyansh> Priyansh Sourav
[13:33] <mbuf> Your distribution should already have GNU Emacs packaged for you to use it
[13:34] <mbuf> Primarily Emacs is a stateless editor, compared to other editors where you have different modes
[13:34] <mbuf> So, you have two important keys Control and Meta (Alt) that you will use when editing
[13:34] <lucifer> Atul kumar
[13:35] <mbuf> Emacs existed even before X window came, and hence, most of the shortcuts were borrowed from it
[13:35] <mbuf> For example, Control-a takes you to the beginning of the line
[13:35] <mbuf> But, the same shortcut will also work in your terminal. So, if you know the shortcuts in Emacs and you can use it in your terminal sessions as well
[13:36] <mbuf> The outer border in Emacs is actually called a frame. Inside a frame, you can have many windows.
[13:36] <mbuf> This is in contrast to the terminology that most you are familiar with that each application is in a window.
[13:37] <mbuf> So, you can have a single frame with multiple windows (or buffers). For example, one window can have IRC chat, another window for coding, another window for the terminal etc.
[13:37] <mbuf> Emacs does have major and minor modes, but, that is mostly for the user to know what shortcuts are available to you
[13:37] <mbuf> After you have installed Emacs using your distribution package manager, you open it and start with the built-in tutorial
[13:38] <mbuf> You use C-h t
[13:38] <neer1> Roll call: Nishanta Sarma
[13:39] <mbuf> I also used the book, "Learning GNU Emacs" http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006488.do
[13:39] <mbuf> You can use Emacs from the X window, or from the terminal
[13:39] <mbuf> You can also start it as a server that runs in the background, and you can open multiple emacsclient frames to connect to it
[13:39] <mbuf> It is quite customizable and extensible
[13:40] <mbuf> Similar to the *nix philosophy, everything in Emacs is a buffer - whether you open a file, or a shell, or connect to IRC, or even browse!
[13:40] <mbuf> It has built-in directory folder management interface called dired.
[13:41] <mbuf> I had written an "Introduction to GNU Emacs" series in Open Source For You magazine (12 articles) which you can also use to learn GNU Emacs
[13:41] <mbuf> http://shakthimaan.com/tags/emacs.html
[13:41] <mbuf> Once, you have got the basic editing, navigation going, you can then explore the different extensions (plugins) that you can use
[13:42] <santoshShaw> Roll Call: Santosh Kumar Shaw
[13:42] <mbuf> If you are a developer or do some coding, you can of course install the necessary syntax highlighting, and extensions available for your language
[13:42] <mbuf> Emacs also has a built-in shell eshell, but, you can also use other shells like ansi-term
[13:43] <mbuf> If everything is inside one frame, then you don't have distractions, and you are focussed on what you are doing
[13:43] <ravindra> Roll call Ravindra Lakal
[13:43] <mbuf> If you have states, then your mind has to switch between what you are doing and which state the editor is in
[13:43] <mbuf> You do not need to know Emacs Lisp to use the editor
[13:44] <mbuf> If you want to do heavy customization, then it is good to know the same
[13:44] <mbuf> The "Writing GNU Emacs Extensions" book is good to learn to extend your editor http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565922617.do
[13:44] <mbuf> One very popular feature of Emacs is Org-mode
[13:45] <mbuf> I use it for project management, planning day-to-day, monthly activities etc. This documentation is a good reference http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html
[13:45] <mbuf> Of course, scrum mode is useful too https://github.com/ianxm/emacs-scrum
[13:46] <mbuf> All your configurations go into ~/.emacs, but, different people have different setups
[13:47] <mbuf> I primarily use Cask, which helps to just list the packages that I want, and setup only the customization
[13:47] <mbuf> We setup repositories to pull plugins from to install software
[13:48] <mbuf> and keep the configuration minimal. If there are any enhancements, you can push to the upstream plugin or library
[13:48] <mbuf> Cask: https://github.com/cask/cask
[13:48] <mbuf> Some people use use-package, but, it depends on your taste
[13:49] <mbuf> You can also IRC chat inside Emacs, using ERC
[13:49] <mbuf> You can browse and read blogs using elfeed (for example), https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed
[13:49] <mbuf> There is a built-in calendar, calculator that you can use
[13:50] <mbuf> With Org-babel, you can execute commands and display the output in the buffer (file) itself so that you can execute scripts
[13:50] <mbuf> The following documentation is an example for "Literate DevOps Using Emacs" http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html
[13:51] <mbuf> I have some examples created as well https://github.com/shakthimaan/literate-devops-using-gnu-emacs
[13:51] <mbuf> You can also store and read .gpg files from GNU Emacs to store your passwords safely
[13:52] <mbuf> Just like opening a file, you can open a socket connection to a VM (on host) or remote
[13:52] <mbuf> For example, /ssh:user@host:/etc/hosts
[13:52] <mbuf> So, you have one interface, and from where you operate on different buffers
[13:53] <mbuf> There is also an rcirc Emacs client available if you want to try
[13:54] <mbuf> Magit allows you to use Git inside Emacs, and it is super-fast; you can also selectively work on thunks
[13:54] <mbuf> For development, your usual auto-completion, project keyword search, function definition all work
[13:54] <mbuf> You should check out helm for the same https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html
[13:55] <mbuf> You can also check e-mails inside GNU Emacs, you will need to set it up of course
[13:56] <mbuf> Gnus has a learning curve https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide/blob/master/gnus-guide-en.org
[13:56] <mbuf> You can also use mu4e
[13:56] <mbuf> Some people prefer to download the e-mails using POP, or IMAP to a local server like dovecot, and then use Emacs just to read the e-mail
[13:57] <mbuf> Some also use postfix server, and then use an e-mail indexer
[13:57] <mbuf> You need to try out different setups for the same depending on what you need
[13:58] <mbuf> If you find using Control and Meta difficult with the keyboard shortcuts, you can re-map the same as well
[13:58] <mbuf> This is one of the reasons I switched from QWERTY to Dvorak
[13:59] <mbuf> If you really want a full-fledged IDE, you can use Emacs Code Browser (ECB)
[13:59] <mbuf> http://ecb.sourceforge.net/
[14:00] <mbuf> There is built-in support for Emacs documentation and reference manuals, so everything is well contained
[14:00] <mbuf> I have barely scratched the surface, but, I wanted to give you an overview of what is available to you
[14:00] <mbuf> But, only if you use it daily will get a good grip of the same, and there is no looking back after that
[14:01] <mbuf> The shortcuts have significant meaning so you don't need to memorize
[14:01] <mbuf> For example, Control-d is to delete a character
[14:02] <mbuf> But, Meta-d is to remove a word or remove the letters from the cursor to the end of the word
[14:02] <mbuf> Once, you get the pattern, you will see that the shortcuts across plugins have meaning
[14:03] <mbuf> Emacs magit shortcut reference is available at https://github.com/shakthimaan/emacs-magit-git-magic
[14:04] <mbuf> There is some notes on the same here http://shakthimaan.com/posts/2013/02/25/introduction-to-magit/news.html
[14:04] <mbuf> I had prepared a quick reference list here https://github.com/shakthimaan/emacs-a-day-keeps-the-vi-zing-away
[14:04] <mbuf> But, you can prepare one or customize to your needs
[14:04] <mbuf> I had also prepared a book generation template for using with Emacs, Org Mode and LaTeX at https://github.com/shakthimaan/xetex-book-template
[14:05] <mbuf> My Emacs cask setup is at https://github.com/shakthimaan/cask-dot-emacs
[14:06] <mbuf> I hope that you will give Emacs a try, and learn from it as much as I have learnt over the years
[14:06] <mbuf> I will now open the floor for Q&A
[14:06] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:06] <mbuf> next
[14:06] <jasonbraganza> does the org in org-mode and org-babel mean something?
[14:07] <jasonbraganza> eom
[14:07] <mbuf> Org = Organizing
[14:07] <jasonbraganza> thank you
[14:07] <mbuf> This is probably a simple tutorial http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html
[14:08] <mbuf> There are quite a few videos on Emacs available online that can watch to get started as well
[14:08] <mbuf> http://emacsrocks.com/ has some good episodes
[14:08] <mbuf> Otherwise, you can simply search in YouTube for emacs videos
[14:09] <mbuf> The NYC Emacs group has some good video recordings http://emacsnyc.org/
[14:10] <bhavin192> !
[14:10] <Phi_mb> !
[14:10] <mbuf> "The Editor of a Lifetime" by Perry Metzger is a good talk as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8
[14:10] <mbuf> next
[14:10] <mbuf> next
[14:10] <bhavin192> emacs is like everything in one, this is contradictory to UNIX philosophy (Write programs that do one thing and do it well.), isn't it?
[14:11] <mbuf> bhavin192, you can run mulitple emacs servers, BTW
[14:11] <Phi_mb> since after the vim session, we are advised to use vim daily, so should i drop it and start learning this new tool?
[14:11] <mbuf> bhavin192, it just gives you a single view, because, that is what your mind needs
[14:12] <mbuf> Phi_mb, vanilla or chocolate?
[14:12] <Phi_mb> mbuf, You learned vim before emacs? Just to know. :)
[14:12] <mbuf> Phi_mb, try both, and pick the one you like
[14:12] <Phi_mb> mbuf, I remember that flavour class. :)
[14:12] <mbuf> Phi_mb, I don't think I learnt anything in vim, or I spent much time with it, honestly
[14:13] <mbuf> Phi_mb, just know how to open, insert, delete and exit
[14:13] <mbuf> Phi_mb, so, I wouldn't say that I know vim that much
[14:13] <Phi_mb> mbuf, Ok thanks for sharing. :)
[14:13] <mbuf> If there is sufficient interest, then we can have a separate session on Emacs Lisp
[14:14] <mbuf> for those who are serious in using it for their day-to-day work
[14:14] <Phi_mb> mbuf, I think I'm interested. :)
[14:14] <mbuf> There are some videos from Emacs NYC group here http://emacsnyc.org/videos.html
[14:15] <mbuf> The "Emacs for Writers" talk is a good example of how someone who does not know coding but still uses Emacs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtieBc3KptU
[14:15] <mbuf> You can maintain finance accounts using ledger inside of Emacs too
[14:16] <mbuf> PDF and image rendering is also possible inside Emacs, so you can view blogs or read reference manuals
[14:16] <mbuf> The Literate DevOps with Emacs talk by Howard is a must watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljNabciEGg&t=111s
[14:17] <mbuf> Sacha Chua has good blog posts on Emacs which you can refer http://sachachua.com/blog/
[14:17] <mbuf> You can also subscribe to her weekly Emacs news for interesting plugins, code snippets and tech videos
[14:18] <mbuf> You will also find useful information from the Emacs wiki https://www.emacswiki.org/
[14:18] <mbuf> I have given you a lot of links today, so take your time going through them
[14:20] <jasonbraganza> mbuf - this was a headrush! thank you!
[14:20] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, wait there is more
[14:20] <jasonbraganza> :)
[14:22] <mbuf> If I have missed out on any, you can try
[14:22] <mbuf> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shakthimaan/shakthimaan-tweets/master/complete.txt | grep -i emacs
[14:22] <mbuf> next
[14:23] <jasonbraganza> mbuf holy moly!
[14:23] <mbuf> Please go through today's log again, patiently and the links and videos
[14:24] <mbuf> I have just given you a brain dump. We can have separate sessions on Org-mode, or other major modes if required
[14:25] <mbuf> Any last minute questions?
[14:25] <ahole[m]> Why use emacs instead of vim?
[14:26] <mbuf> ahole[m], I use Emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor  Neal Stephenson (In the Beginning Was the Command Line)
[14:26] <ahole[m]> I have had a little experience with both vim and emacs. I find vim and nano are a bit easy to use and learn when compared to emacs.
[14:26] <mbuf> ahole[m], it is your choice
[14:27] <mbuf> ahole[m], I shall leave you with the quotes on Emacs at http://shakthimaan.com/posts/2016/04/04/introduction-to-gnu-emacs/news.html
[14:27] <mbuf> EMACS could not have been reached by a process of careful design, because such processes arrive only at goals which are visible at the outset, and whose desirability is established on the bottom line at the outset. Neither I nor anyone else visualized an extensible editor until I had made one, nor appreciated its value until he had experienced it. EMACS exists because I felt free to make individually useful small improvements on a path whose end was not in
[14:27] <mbuf> sight.  Richard Stallman
[14:28] <ahole[m]> The quotes are truly inspiring.
[14:28] <mbuf> ahole[m], you should try it to experience it

[13:34] <puiterwijk> Okay, so GPG is an abreviation for GnuPG, which itself is an abreviation for GNU Privacy Guard.
[13:34] <ahole[m]> me
[13:34] <championshuttler> i dont have key but have idea about it
[13:35] <puiterwijk> It's basically an implementation of a crypto system you can use to exchange encrypted messages or sign messages

[13:35] <puiterwijk> For first, make sure you can run "gpg --version" or "gpg2 --version" and it gives a version number. If not, now's the time to install it
[13:36] <puiterwijk> The package is called "gnupg" (for v1) ofr "gnupg2" (for v2) in Fedora and Ubuntu
[13:36] <puiterwijk> Preferably you would use gpg2 by now, but if you only have gpg, that's fine too.
[13:37] <puiterwijk> I will probably just say "gpg" in the example commands, because I have done an alias gpg=gpg2 because I like typing less. But most commands should be identical between both
[13:38] <puiterwijk> Is there anyone that doesn't have a version output with "gpg --version"?
[13:39] <puiterwijk> So, let's first get you all a GPG key, so that we can start showing things by example
[13:39] <soumam007> roll call : soumam banerjee soryy for being late
[13:39] <puiterwijk> run this command: "gpg2 --gen-key" to start the key generation wizard
[13:40] <puiterwijk> It will ask you for your name, email address and comment. Please enter your actual name/email there, and leave comment empty (just press enter). Then hit O and enter when it asks to confirm.
[13:40] <ashwanig> !
[13:40] <puiterwijk> If you're using gpg1, it will also ask about key type and size (leave those to default) and expiration (enter 2y and press enter, and confirm))
[13:40] <puiterwijk> ashwanig: yes?
[13:41] <ashwanig> sorry by mistake
[13:41] <puiterwijk> Ah, okay
[13:41] <saptaks> !
[13:41] <puiterwijk> After that, it will ask you for a passphrase. Enter a strong passowrd there, and hit Ok
[13:41] <puiterwijk> (you will need to enter it twice)
[13:41] <puiterwijk> saptaks: yes?
[13:41] <poojaencoded> !
[13:42] <saptaks> can/should I have multiple gpg keys for the same email id?
[13:42] <Cyber_freak> !
[13:42] <sayan> next
[13:42] <sayan> next
[13:42] <puiterwijk> saptaks: you can have that, yes. But it will most likely confuse you and others that are trying to send you a message. I would suggest holding off with that for now
[13:43] <adas0496> hello
[13:43] <puiterwijk> If there's time left, I can explain more about how multi-key works
[13:43] <adas0496> seems I am late. sorry for interruption
[13:43] <saptaks> puiterwijk: okay
[13:43] <puiterwijk> next
[13:43] <puiterwijk> (oooh, this bot is fancy!)
[13:43] <Cyber_freak> done saptaks asked my question
[13:44] <poojaencoded> https://pastebin.com/01bSU1km
[13:44] <poojaencoded> this is showing <eof>
[13:45] <puiterwijk> poojaencoded: okay, that's what I said with the gpg1 case: then hit enter to default on keysize, hit enter to default on key type, and then enter 2y enter, y enter
[13:45] <puiterwijk> (gpg2 takes these values as default)
[13:45] <poojaencoded> ok puiterwijk
[13:45] <puiterwijk> next
[13:45] <puiterwijk> next
[13:46] <puiterwijk> Okay. So, is anyone still busy generating a key?
[13:46] <sandeepK> !
[13:46] <bhavin192> !
[13:46] <puiterwijk> next
[13:46] <sandeepK> I got this error
[13:46] <sandeepK> https://pastebin.com/KVkcrMrS
[13:46] <CHOCOS1> anyone pm me the logs i am late :(
[13:46] <ashwanig> !
[13:46] <puiterwijk> that looks like you didn't enter a passphrase twice?
[13:47] <puiterwijk> (or hit ctrl-c)
[13:47] <Cyber_freak> CHOCOS1: the session is still going
[13:48] <puiterwijk> next
[13:48] <ahole[m]> !
[13:48] <sandeepK> puiterwijk it did not asked for any pharse
[13:48] <bhavin192> I'm getting `Error: The trustdb is corrupted`. Trying to fix it
[13:48] <shivamA1> !
[13:48] <ravindra> !
[13:48] <puiterwijk> sandeepK: hmm, okay. That sounds like you might be using GNOME and the gnome-keyring comes in the middle
[13:49] <puiterwijk> Maybe you can try in a VM or something that doesn't have GNOME?
[13:49] <sandeepK> puiterwijk ok
[13:49] <puiterwijk> bhavin192: if you're using gnupg1, rm ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg
[13:49] <puiterwijk> next
[13:49] <ashwanig> Should I delete the key if passphrase is forgotten?<eof>
[13:49] <bhavin192> puiterwijk, got it working :)
[13:49] <balaji> !
[13:50] <bhavin192> puiterwijk, I'm using gnupg2
[13:50] <puiterwijk> ashwanig: I would suggest against deleting the key in that case, since other people might still use it, and you might remember the passphrase later. And if you delete the key, you can't decrypt anything anymore
[13:50] <puiterwijk> bhavin192: ah, okay
[13:50] <puiterwijk> next
[13:50] <ahole[m]> why do we need a gpg key in the first place?
[13:51] <puiterwijk> ahole[m]: so, a gpg key is the key with which you can sign messages or other people can encrypt messages to you.
[13:51] <apoorv> !
[13:51] <sitlanigaurav[m]> bhavin192: try doing it under sudo
[13:51] <shivamA1> It's showing trustdb is corrupted
[13:51] <poojaencoded> !
[13:51] <puiterwijk> Did anyone ever tell you about the CIA of security?
[13:51] <puiterwijk> shivamA1: then try it with gpg1
[13:52] <sitlanigaurav[m]> puiterwijk: no
[13:52] <puiterwijk> Basically, with a GPG key you can encrypt messages between you and the receiver of the message, so that other people that are listening in to you can not see what you're saying
[13:52] <ahole[m]> puiterwijk: Nope
[13:52] <sitlanigaurav[m]> puiterwijk: i got the same error but got resolved when i used with sudo
[13:52] <championshuttler> CHOCOS1: i pm you :)
[13:52] <championshuttler>        !
[13:53] <championshuttler> !
[13:53] <Cyber_freak> championshuttler: already did pm to CHOCOS1
[13:53] <im_mohsin> Can someone please send me previous log of this session? problem with network
[13:53] <Cyber_freak> wait im_mohsin
[13:53] <puiterwijk> Okay, so in security there's three key words: Confidentiallity (can only the intended recipient read the messages), Integrity (did the message not get changed by someone else) and Availability
[13:53] <championshuttler> im_mohsin: pm me :)
[13:54] <puiterwijk> If you abreviate those three words, it reads "CIA"
[13:54] <shivamA1> It's working puiterwijk
[13:54] <im_mohsin> championshuttler, Got it :)
[13:54] <puiterwijk> So, with GPG you can encrypt a message, which gives you confidentiallity, and you can sign a message, which provides integrity
[13:54] <ahole[m]> !
[13:54] <puiterwijk> next
[13:54] <knrai> !
[13:56] <puiterwijk> next
[13:56] <ravindra> I am getting this error https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/T1lCePFnCkbGGZHYN8rYKw tried using sudo too
[13:56] <puiterwijk> ravindra: is this with gpg2 or gpg?
[13:57] <ravindra> gpg2
[13:57] <puiterwijk> Okay, can you try with gpg?
[13:57] <ravindra> ok
[13:57] <puiterwijk> next
[13:57] <balaji> How can I see my generated key?
[13:58] <championshuttler> ravindra: i think you exit during generation
[13:58] <puiterwijk> balaji: great question: run gpg(or gpg2) --list-secret-keys
[13:58] <puiterwijk> Do note: if you generated the key with gpg, use gpg for the rest of the session. If you generated it with gpg2, use that from now on. And if you ran it with sudo, you will have to continue to use sudo from now on
[13:59] <puiterwijk> (at least for now, I can help look further into all these failures later probably)
[13:59] <puiterwijk> next
[13:59] <apoorv> what is the use of asking email  address it asked?
[13:59] <puiterwijk> apoorv: GPG uses the email address to determine which key to use when people send you a message
[13:59] <puiterwijk> You can look up a GPG key by email address, e.g.: https://keys.fedoraproject.org/pks/lookup?search=patrick%40puiterwijk.org&op=vindex
[14:00] <apoorv> okay thank you
[14:00] <puiterwijk> next
[14:00] <poojaencoded> puiterwijk, after real name and email id it is asking  for comment
[14:00] <puiterwijk> poojaencoded: right. Just hit enter there
[14:00] <puiterwijk> Leave that empty for now
[14:00] <poojaencoded> ok
[14:00] <puiterwijk> That's more useful if you have multiple keys
[14:00] <puiterwijk> next
[14:00] <championshuttler> is whatsapp using gpg key?
[14:00] <puiterwijk> championshuttler: no. They have their own system
[14:01] <puiterwijk> They could use it, but I don't think they are
[14:01] <puiterwijk> next
[14:01] <balaji> puiterwijk, It shows sec and ssb in secret keys . Can you explain that ?
[14:01] <ahole[m]> putty-gen does something  similar right ?
[14:01] <knrai> what is 'Availability' ?
[14:02] <puiterwijk> ahole[m]: putty-gen generates an SSH key, which is used for authentication purposes. But yes, it also generates a key, the key is just used differently
[14:02] <puiterwijk> next
[14:02] <knrai> what is 'Availability' ?
[14:02] <puiterwijk> knrai: Availability comes down to that the system should be Available, so people should be able to use it
[14:03] <puiterwijk> In other words, a server that is powered off is totally secure, but not available :)
[14:03] <ashwanig> knrai, Where did you find Availability?
[14:03] <puiterwijk> ashwanig: I just explained the CIA of security
[14:03] <puiterwijk> (Confidentiallity, Integrity, Availability)
[14:04] <ashwanig> puiterwijk, Ah okay :)
[14:04] <puiterwijk> Okay. So I'm going to assume that everyone now has at least a GPG key.
[14:04] <puiterwijk> Let's move on to how you can use it
[14:04] <puiterwijk> First, as I already said earlier: please run gpg --list-secret-keys, that should list your key
[14:05] <puiterwijk> (as I said before: use the same command for "gpg" that you used when generating the key, whether that's gpg, gpg2, or sudo gpg(2))
[14:06] <puiterwijk> That will print output that contains for example a line like "sec   rsa2048/0x3C0F28BCB48895CF 2017-07-19 [SC] [expires: 2019-07-19]"
[14:06] <puiterwijk> After that, it will print a line "uid                   [ultimate] DGPlug Testing <dgplug@example.com>"
[14:06] <shivamA1> puiterwijk: can u repeat the command
[14:07] <puiterwijk> shivamA1: gpg --list-secret-keys
[14:07] <shivamA1> Okay ty
[14:07] <shivamA1> Thank you
[14:07] <puiterwijk> Those lines contain a lot of information.
[14:07] <kushal> shivamA1, Kicking you out for typing in sms language.
[14:07] <anuGupta> !
[14:07] <puiterwijk> The uid line contains the name and email address
[14:07] <puiterwijk> next
[14:08] <anuGupta> Actually I tried using both got and gpg2 .what I found was using gpg created secrings and pubrings
[14:08] <puiterwijk> anuGupta: correct. That is no problem, just ignore that for now
[14:08] <anuGupta> I am using gpg2<eof>
[14:09] <shivamA1> Sorry won't do it again kushal please
[14:09] <anuGupta> Ok
[14:09] <puiterwijk> Okay, so, the "uid" line contains your name and email, this is called the User ID (thus uid)
[14:09] <puiterwijk> The other interesting line for now is the "sec" line
[14:09] <puiterwijk> That tells you that that's a secret key
[14:10] <hemanth_> !
[14:10] <puiterwijk> the next part, rsa2048 is the key type and size: RSA algorithm, 2048 bits
[14:10] <puiterwijk> The next part, that starts with 0x3C0F... in my case is the key ID. That's a unique identifier for this key
[14:10] <puiterwijk> The next field is the creation date (I created this today, so it says 2017-07-19)
[14:11] <puiterwijk> the "SC" part indicates that this is a primary key ("C" for Certify) and that it is used when you sign things ("S" for Sign), and the last part is indicating when this key will expire
[14:11] <puiterwijk> next
[14:11] <hemanth_> why is there "[ultimate]" written  before name and email-ID
[14:12] <puiterwijk> hemanth_: that is an indicator by GPG that this key is marked as "ultimately trusted", which basically means that it's a key you generated yourself
[14:12] <apoorv> !
[14:12] <skarpy>  !
[14:12] <puiterwijk> in GPG, you can mark keys as trusted to a certain level. And ultimate is the top level, which is used for your own keys (since you're pretty sure who you are, hopefully)
[14:12] <puiterwijk> next
[14:12] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[14:12] <apoorv> no expire part in mine ?
[14:13] <hemanth_> thank you puiterwijk
[14:13] <devesh_verma__> !
[14:13] <ashwanig> !
[14:13] <kishore> !
[14:13] <apoorv> s/there is
[14:13] <puiterwijk> apoorv: then you probably didn't generate the key just now, or you entered a "0" during creation for expiration. That's fine for now
[14:13] <im_mohsin> !
[14:13] <apoorv> okay
[14:13] <puiterwijk> My personal suggestion is to make keys that last two years and then generate a new one, so you change keys often, and that if you lose the private key it's not a big problem
[14:13] <puiterwijk> (since people will stop using it)
[14:14] <puiterwijk> next
[14:14] <sitlanigaurav[m]> In the SC part , what does it certify?
[14:14] <anuGupta> !
[14:14] <avik> !
[14:14] <sitlanigaurav[m]> And why is it done?
[14:14] <puiterwijk> sitlanigaurav[m]: that key is used to sign the "uid" part of the key. So, basically, with that key you sign a statement "I am $myname"
[14:14] <skarpy> !
[14:14] <puiterwijk> That is done when you generate a key, or add extra uids or other subkeys to the key
[14:15] <puiterwijk> next
[14:15] <devesh_verma__> done
[14:15] <puiterwijk> next
[14:15] <ashwanig> What does ssb stand for? <eom>
[14:15] <kishore> What is the typical application for gpg?
[14:15] <puiterwijk> ashwanig: that's a Secret SuBkey
[14:16] <ashwanig> What is that?
[14:16] <puiterwijk> kishore: a lot of people use it for 1. sending emails, or 2. verifying messages from other people
[14:16] <kishore> ok
[14:16] <puiterwijk> ashwanig: basically, a second GPG key that's "attached" to the main key.
[14:16] <puiterwijk> next
[14:16] <atultherajput> !
[14:16] <puiterwijk> next
[14:16] <im_mohsin> After the key expires, i have to use the same command to generate a new or anything else to update?
[14:17] <maxking> !
[14:17] <ahole[m]> !
[14:17] <puiterwijk> im_mohsin: my suggestion would be to generate a new key, but you could edit the key to change the expiration date
[14:17] <puiterwijk> next
[14:17] <anuGupta> I am having the expired date the same,that is, today's date <eof>
[14:17] <puiterwijk> anuGupta: can you paste the "sec" line here?
[14:17] <skat_sd> !
[14:17] <anuGupta> Ok
[14:18] <ahole[m]> How to actually use it to the first two point?
[14:18] <ahole[m]> kishore: a lot of people use it for 1. sending emails, or 2. verifying messages from other people
[14:18] <bhavin192> ahole[m], have patience
[14:19] <puiterwijk> next
[14:19] <shivamA1> !
[14:19] <ahole[m]> Apology for speaking out of turn. Got a bit excited.
[14:19] <puiterwijk> ahole[m]: no worries. Basically, you want an email client that supports it. Either thunderbird (with the enigmail extension) or mutt (text-based) are good choices in my opinion
[14:19] <puiterwijk> avik: ?
[14:20] <avik> puiterwijk, will it be possible for you to give an live demo of using the gpg keys?
[14:20] <kushal> avik, He is giving that only.
[14:20] <puiterwijk> avik: I was hoping to get time to do that today :)
[14:20] <puiterwijk> next
[14:20] <skarpy> In both sec and ssb, we have different key id, which one is to provide? Also my date of expiry is same as date of issue. Why so?
[14:20] <avik> ok :D
[14:20] <puiterwijk> skarpy: the sec one. And can you paste the "sec" line here?
[14:20] <skarpy> puiterwijk: ok
[14:20] <puiterwijk> next
[14:21] <atultherajput> I got this https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/LM8pn-8hFg-Hj6E6l43S7w . Is this okay?
[14:21] <anuGupta> paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/MynNRzNwvUqqn~vEUaF8og
[14:21] <puiterwijk> anuGupta: you do not have an expiration date. You just have two creation dates, one for the primary key and one for the subkey
[14:21] <puiterwijk> atultherajput: yes. Same as anuGupta
[14:21] <puiterwijk> skarpy: please check your output against anuGupta's. If it looks the same, same answer applies to you
[14:21] <puiterwijk> next
[14:22] <atultherajput> okay :)
[14:22] <maxking> How does the trust work in case of subkeys? Does it have exact same level of trust as the master key?
[14:22] <anuGupta> Ok
[14:22] <puiterwijk> maxking: trust is assigned to the primary key and to the uids, not to subkeys.
[14:22] <skarpy> puiterwijk: so how should i know when the key will expire? yes its same.
[14:23] <puiterwijk> skarpy: then your key doesn't expire
[14:23] <puiterwijk> (that means your gpg2 had a different default)
[14:23] <skarpy> puiterwijk: cant i generate something which can expire at a certain time?
[14:23] <puiterwijk> maxking: or even more correct: you trust a "uid", not a key.
[14:23] <Cyber_freak> !
[14:23] <puiterwijk> skarpy: you can, but then you need the full generation wizard: gpg2 --full-generate-key
[14:23] <maxking> puiterwijk: thanks, that makes sense actually.
[14:23] <shivamA1> !
[14:23] <puiterwijk> maxking: great! :)
[14:23] <devesh_verma__> !
[14:23] <skarpy> puiterwijk: ok, thanks :)
[14:23] <puiterwijk> next
[14:24] <ahole[m]> already asked
[14:24] <puiterwijk> next
[14:24] <skat_sd> How do I make keys last for a specific time, i.e. set an expiration date(like you said it is good to keep keys for 2 years and then change)? I have the same case as anuGupta and atultherajput .
[14:24] <puiterwijk> skat_sd: okay, so generate the key with gpg2 --full-generate-key
[14:24] <puiterwijk> That will ask you what expiration date you want
[14:24] <puiterwijk> next
[14:24] <shivamA1> Is it possible to have multiple keys with same email id, here mine is showing 2 keys !
[14:25] <Cyber_freak> puiterwijk: What is the benefit of the expire feature of the key as we can have key that do not expire also ?
[14:25] <puiterwijk> Yes, that is possible, but might be confusing. For now, don't worry too much
[14:25] <puiterwijk> next
[14:25] <mayur01> !
[14:26] <puiterwijk> Cyber_freak: so, I suggest all people that start with PGP to use an expiring key. At some point, you are likely to lose access to the private key, and then you can't revoke the key so that other people stop using it. If it expires, everyone will stop using it at expiration date
[14:27] <Cyber_freak> thanks puiterwijk got it :-)
[14:27] <puiterwijk> next
[14:27] <devesh_verma__> is this correct because I was not getting similar output to anuGupta   https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/MS9P6w3gSPLT2x02pWU6jA
[14:27] <puiterwijk> (and yes, there are other ways to revoke it)
[14:27] <deepika> !
[14:27] <CHOCOS1> !
[14:27] <neer> !
[14:27] <puiterwijk> devesh_verma__: yeah, same reply: your key doesn't have an expiry, abnd can use gpg2 --full-generate-key to generate a new key that expires
[14:27] <puiterwijk> next
[14:27] <mayur01> Can I delete my key before expiration? <eom>
[14:28] <devesh_verma__> !
[14:29] <puiterwijk> mayur01: if you generated the key just now: yes. Run gpg --delete-secret-keys $keyid
[14:29] <puiterwijk> next
[14:29] <deepika> I was having trouble  because of gpg agent in generation though fixed, yet wanted to know what role does it play in key generation
[14:29] <deepika> <eom>
[14:29] <mayur01> Ok Thank you.
[14:29] <puiterwijk> deepika: with gpg1: not much, with gpg2: everything. A major change between gpg1 and gpg2 is that all the crypto operations have moved to the GPG agent, so without an agent, GPG2 can't work
[14:30] <puiterwijk> (with gpg1 it's just used to store your passphrase temporarily in computer memory so you don't need to re-enter it every single time)
[14:30] <puiterwijk> next
[14:30] <CHOCOS1> gpg --list-secret-keys i am not getting any output for this :(
[14:30] <puiterwijk> CHOCOS1: what command did you run to generate the key?
[14:31] <CHOCOS1> sorry my mistake got it
[14:31] <puiterwijk> next
[14:31] <neer> Even my key doesn't expire,, so should i delete my .gnupg directory and then fully generate key?<eom>
[14:31] <puiterwijk> neer: for now, yes.
[14:31] <puiterwijk> next
[14:31] <devesh_verma__> in anuGupta output theres a big number after [SC] but for me I have a number after rsa2048/ I dont have that in mine. Why is there such difference ?
[14:32] <deepika> puiterwijk Oh thanks, understood :)
[14:32] <skat_sd> !
[14:32] <puiterwijk> devesh_verma__: that's just a different in output. The big number is the full key fingerprint, which is the longer version of what is behind rsa2048
[14:32] <puiterwijk> (the key ID is the last 16 characters of the fingerprint)
[14:32] <puiterwijk> next
[14:33] <skat_sd> this command <gpg2 --full-generate-key> is not working,output:<gpg: invalid option "--full-generate-key">, do i need to delete anything before regenerating key?
[14:33] <devesh_verma__> puiterwijk so its all same, just the way of showing is different .  am I right ?
[14:33] <puiterwijk> skat_sd: what does "gpg2 --version" return?
[14:33] <puiterwijk> devesh_verma__: correct
[14:34] <puiterwijk> skat_sd: also, try: --full-gen-key
[14:34] <skat_sd> puiterwijk, it does give out version number.gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.13
[14:34] <puiterwijk> I think --full-generate-key was added in a later version as a more expressive version
[14:34] <puiterwijk> skat_sd: okay, try: gpg2 --full-gen-key
[14:34] <puiterwijk> next
[14:34] <skat_sd> puiterwijk, yes this one works now
[14:34] <championshuttler> skat_sd: use gpg2 --full-gen-key
[14:34] <skat_sd> Thanks
[14:34] <kvy_> !
[14:35] <puiterwijk> next
[14:35] <skat_sd> championshuttler, yes, works
[14:35] <bhavin192> !
[14:35] <kvy_> can i edit a key
[14:35] <kvy_> <eof>
[14:35] <anuGupta> !
[14:35] <puiterwijk> kvy_: depends on what you want to edit on the key
[14:35] <puiterwijk> next
[14:35] <bhavin192> Can you please share your output of `gpg2 --list-secret-keys`?
[14:36] <balaji> !
[14:36] <puiterwijk> bhavin192: sure: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/buB93LIszhr7x0mGF2r71Q
[14:36] <puiterwijk> next
[14:36] <anuGupta> Do I need to create the key that expires?right now?<eof>
[14:36] <kushal> Everyone please stop asking questions for now.
[14:36] <puiterwijk> anuGupta: nah, you can continue with a non-expiring for now. But I would suggest to do so before using it
[14:36] <puiterwijk> next
[14:37] <kushal> You just learned 2 commands still now, let puiterwijk first finish his session
[14:37] <kushal> puiterwijk, you can skip the questions for now, and go ahead
[14:37] <puiterwijk> Okay
[14:37] <puiterwijk> So, let's assume for now you have a key.
[14:37] <puiterwijk> Now create a text file with some content in it (exampl
[14:37] <puiterwijk> example: echo hello >foobar
[14:38] <puiterwijk> Then you can encrypt that message to you: run "gpg -r $your-email --encrypt foobar"
[14:38] <puiterwijk> Then, for fun, run "cat foobar.gpg". You will see that that is just binary "nonsense"
[14:40] <vharsh> !
[14:40] <puiterwijk> That is an encrypted message. It can only be read with the private key belonging to the key you encrypted for
[14:40] <puiterwijk> If you run "gpg --decrypt foobar.gpg", GPG will decrypt the message for you
[14:40] <puiterwijk> next
[14:40] <vharsh> I couldn't figure out the difference between, --list-keys & --list-secret-keys
[14:40] <vharsh> I searched online somewhat<eof>
[14:41] <puiterwijk> vharsh: if you run "gpg --keyserver keys.fedoraproject.org --recv-keys 0x8657980D9AB51E50" and tlet that finish, check again :)
[14:41] <vharsh> puiterwijk, It'll get your keys?
[14:41] <puiterwijk> Basically, --list-keys list all the GPG keys your computer has seen, where as --list-secret-keys lists only the GPG keys you have a private key for
[14:41] <puiterwijk> vharsh: yes. Which will only show up in --list-keys and not in --list-secret-keys
[14:42] <puiterwijk> (because hopefully you don't have my private key :) )
[14:43] <kushal> Also everyone, please keep all the questions for later, first let puiterwijk finish the session.
[14:43] <NikitaK3> !
[14:43] <puiterwijk> Okay, so now let's do some cross-messaging
[14:43] <puiterwijk> Please run this command: gpg --keyserver keys.fedoraproject.org --recv-keys 0x8657980D9AB51E50
[14:43] <puiterwijk> That will make your client pull down my GPG keys, so that we can run some tests
[14:44] <puiterwijk> You can put some text in a file, and run "gpg --armor -r patrick@puiterwijk.org --encrypt $filename" to generate a $filename.asc
[14:44] <puiterwijk> If someone could do that, and put the contents of the .asc file onto pastebin, we can try it out!
[14:45] <mbtamuli12> puiterwijk: http://sprunge.us/RYaY
[14:46] <vharsh> http://dpaste.com/2M97Q53
[14:46] <puiterwijk> mbtamuli12: hello to you too
[14:46] <kushal> :)
[14:47] <puiterwijk> vharsh: hello vharsh as well
[14:47] <puiterwijk> So, you should now try to decrypt it yourself: run gpg --decrypt $filename.asc
[14:47] <ashwanig> !
[14:47] <puiterwijk> Gpg will most likely error out saying that you do not have the private key for the message
[14:48] <shivam98[m]> !
[14:49] <puiterwijk> So, that is how you can encrypt a message with GPG and decrypt it
[14:49] <puiterwijk> Now, anotehr major use case of gpg would be to verify a message.

[14:50] <puiterwijk> ahole[m]: yep, that's exactly correct, since you do not have my private key :)
[14:50] <ashwanig> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/m9XLurc522bbS2cLU6S~eA
[14:50] <bhavin192> ahole[m], gpg --keyserver keys.fedoraproject.org --recv-keys 0x8657980D9AB51E50
[14:50] <bhavin192> ahole[m], this should be run with gpg2...

[14:51] <puiterwijk> bhavin192: no, he's trying to decrypt a message encrypted for me, which he can't :)
[14:51] <shivam98[m]> getting error https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/F2~T70aiwVUvgwZZ6yWBow
[14:52] <puiterwijk> shivam98[m]: echo "Hello" > foobar.
[14:52] <bhavin192> puiterwijk, ah! right
[14:52] <kushal> Everyone, please read what puiterwijk said a few lines above.
[14:52] <jasonbraganza> puiterwijk - maybe we move ahead :)
[14:52] <puiterwijk> So, another major important thing for GPG, is verifying things
[14:52] <puiterwijk> Open this: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/NxevNeyuriG3o-069ef-ig/raw
[14:52] <puiterwijk> Put this in a file ("signed.asc"), and run gpg --verify signed.asc
[14:53] <puiterwijk> That should tell you that that file was signed by me, and that it correctly verified it
[14:53] <jasonbraganza> yes
[14:54] <puiterwijk> So, to generate such a file yourself: run this: gpg --clearsign foobar
[14:54] <ahole[m]> Still the same error https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/f1kxlzLsxS6u5f03-79dTQ/raw
[14:54] <puiterwijk> ahole[m]: that makes totaly sense, and you won't be able to decrypt that ever, since it was encrypted for me :)
[14:54] <kushal> ahole[m], One day you will learn to read what we are saying.
[14:55] <puiterwijk> This was to demonstrate exactly what GPG is used for: making sure that only the intended recipient can read the message.
[14:55] <ahole[m]> kushal: puiterwijk oh yeah!
[14:55] <puiterwijk> The only way for you to ever decrypt that would be if I send you my private key... which I'm not going to do :)
[14:55] <devesh_verma__> !
[14:55] <ahole[m]> kushal: Sorry
[14:56] <devesh_verma__> puiterwijk does everyone need to create the file ?
[14:56] <puiterwijk> So, let's see how we are on questions now, since this was basically the core for now
[14:56] <ahole[m]> puiterwijk: Ha ha ha
[14:56] <puiterwijk> devesh_verma__: I would suggest trying it out, just to see it once
[14:56] <apoorv> !
[14:56] <puiterwijk> next
[14:57] <puiterwijk> Oh, we're that far back. Okay.
[14:57] <NikitaK3> done
[14:57] <puiterwijk> next
[14:57] <ashwanig> already answered
[14:57] <puiterwijk> next
[14:58] <devesh_verma__> puiterwijk how to I use it for a file ?
[14:58] <puiterwijk> devesh_verma__: what do you mean there?
[14:58] <puiterwijk> next
[14:58] <atultherajput> I am getting error while encrypting and decrypting files. https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/LITpi5neHdHAa2w8e9B9RA
[14:58] <kushal> devesh_verma__, Read the whole session log from start again after we finish.
[14:59] <shivam98[m]> after doing gpg --clearsign foobar
[14:59] <shivam98[m]> what i suppose to do
[14:59] <devesh_verma__> puiterwijk yeah correct I am lost now :)
[14:59] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[14:59] <puiterwijk> atultherajput: that looks like you had an older key that you lost. I would suggest mv ~/.gnupg ~/.gnupg.old and restarting to try
[15:00] <puiterwijk> shivam98[m]: so, you got a signed message. Put that in a file, and run "gpg --verify $filename". That should show you that you signed that message
[15:00] <puiterwijk> next
[15:00] <lucifer> !
[15:00] <apoorv> when I try to decrypt it is showing this error gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
[15:00] <atultherajput> okay :)
[15:00] <apoorv> <eof>
[15:00] <puiterwijk> apoorv: if the line before that mentioned puiterwijk@gmail.com: that's correct, you don't have my secret key. If it doesn't, look at my response to atultherajput as you also had a prior key
[15:00] <puiterwijk> next
[15:00] <devesh_verma__> done
[15:00] <sitlanigaurav[m]> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/FMQzb7R-cmHdHC~QsOimcQ/
[15:00] <sitlanigaurav[m]> when i used clearsign, i had overwrited my file, was it meant to happen?
[15:01] <puiterwijk> sitlanigaurav[m]: if you run it a second time, yes, that's expected. But unless that file was very important to you, that's fine
[15:01] <puiterwijk> next
[15:01] <puiterwijk> next
[15:01] <lucifer> i m getting this error https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/QbdtfL-W-JAdDm~7BYDx~w
[15:02] <puiterwijk> lucifer: you probably created the key with gpg2
[15:02] <skarpy> !
[15:02] <puiterwijk> or with sudo gpg. You need to keep using the same command every time
[15:02] <puiterwijk> next
[15:02] <lucifer> yeah sorry! that was silly!
[15:02] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[15:02] <kushal> lucifer, what is i m?
[15:02] <puiterwijk> next
[15:03] <championshuttler> !
[15:03] <kushal> lucifer, Two random characters from the nearest planet?
[15:03] <sitlanigaurav[m]> so if i need to verify using clearsign i need to send someone that file?
[15:03] <skarpy> puiterwijk: pass
[15:03] <puiterwijk> sitlanigaurav[m]: yes. And they will also need your public GPG key
[15:04] <puiterwijk> sitlanigaurav[m]: if you run "gpg --armor --export >mykey", you get a file to send that contains your public key
[15:05] <lucifer> sorry kushal ! :(
[15:05] <puiterwijk> next
[15:05] <championshuttler> after typing gpg2 --verify $foobar , terminal is in some like process but no response from more than a minute :(
[15:05] <sitlanigaurav[m]> thanks :)
[15:06] <puiterwijk> championshuttler: you need to remove the $ :)
[15:06] <puiterwijk> When I say "$filename", I mean to replace that entire string with the filename, sorry :)
[15:06] <championshuttler> still same
[15:06] <puiterwijk> next
[15:06] <skarpy> !
[15:06] <puiterwijk> championshuttler: does the file "foobar" exist?
[15:07] <puiterwijk> next
[15:07] <skarpy> puiterwijk: but my signature verification failed.
[15:07] <puiterwijk> skarpy: did you verify it with the same gpg command you've used to generate your key and the signature?
[15:07] <puiterwijk> (aka, gpg vs gpg2)
[15:07] <puiterwijk> the other will not have your public key
[15:07] <skarpy> puiterwijk: yes
[15:08] <skarpy> puiterwijk: i tried both
[15:08] <puiterwijk> skarpy: can you fpaste the shell where you signed and verified?
[15:08] <championshuttler> yes https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/aJyTbjoxYyoZGFR760X0Tw
[15:08] <puiterwijk> championshuttler: ahh. If you --clearsign'ed foobar, you want to --verify foobar.asc
[15:08] <puiterwijk> skarpy: I think the same problem might be for you as well: did you add the ".asc" to the file to verify?
[15:09] <skarpy> puiterwijk: yes
[15:09] <puiterwijk> Okay, can yo uthen fpaste the entire terminal?
[15:09] <puiterwijk> (or at least the --clearsign and --verify parts?)
[15:09] <skarpy> puiterwijk: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/RzdTFe01AEU0fllbYzxBKw
[15:10] <puiterwijk> skarpy: could you fpaste the contents of ap.txt.asc?
[15:11] <skarpy> puiterwijk: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/euquEE3mbWDP5jSfOerIjQ
[15:11] <championshuttler> puitewijk: is it fine now? https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/5cuw50GJfMVolbSgnAZfsQ
[15:11] <puiterwijk> skarpy: that is not a --clearsign'ed message, but a message encrypted for me
[15:12] <puiterwijk> skarpy: so, run "gpg --clearsign ap.txt >ap.txt.asc" and then retry verify
[15:12] <puiterwijk> championshuttler: yep. That's a success :)
[15:12] <skat_sd> !
[15:12] <puiterwijk> next
[15:12] <skat_sd> Why do we get this warning: gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
[15:12] <skat_sd> gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
[15:12] <puiterwijk> skat_sd: that is because you never told GPG that you trust that key. For now, you can ignore that
[15:13] <skat_sd> ok
[15:13] <skat_sd> thanks
[15:13] <puiterwijk> Basically, you can sign a key as in saying that you trust it
[15:13] <puiterwijk> GPG by default works with a "web of trust" model
[15:13] <skarpy> puiterwijk: success!:)
[15:14] <puiterwijk> You can sign keys, adn then send those signatures to the keyservers or other people. When you sign a key, you're telling GPG that you trust that key is owned by the person listed in the "uid" field.
[15:14] <puiterwijk> And the "web" part of "web of trust" comes in because if I trust Kushal's key, and Kushal trust someone else's key, my client knows that it can trust that other key because I trust Kushal
[15:15] <puiterwijk> For more info on that part, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust
[15:15] <puiterwijk> So when you sign a key, it will from then on no longer be marked as "WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature"
[15:15] <kushal> Never sign keys without verifying them first.
[15:16] <puiterwijk> Yep. They are a statement that you make that you trust that that key is owned by the person mentioned in the uid, and that they control that email address
[15:16] <devesh_verma__> !
[15:17] <puiterwijk> Okay, I guess that's the core parts of GPG I wanted to show for today: creating a key, basic encryption, decryption, signing and verification
[15:17] <puiterwijk> next
[15:17] <devesh_verma__> puiterwijk I did this and nothing happining its been more than 5mins https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sGpaAK0M26Dl1sHqYIeGJQ
[15:17] <puiterwijk> devesh_verma__: remove the $
[15:17] <puiterwijk> So use gpg --armor -r patrick@puiterwijk.org --encrypt foobargpg
[15:18] <puiterwijk> That means that GPG is just waiting for you to enter contents, because there's no variable $foobargpg
[15:18] <devesh_verma__> did that it accepted y and then nothing happened
[15:19] <puiterwijk> Right, because then it's waiting for the contents of your message
[15:19] <puiterwijk> Did you cancel the run you pasted, removed the $, and retried?
[15:19] <devesh_verma__> yes
[15:19] <puiterwijk> So, you can also just type now and then press Ctrl-d
[15:20] <puiterwijk> Are there any other questions?
[15:20] <jasonbraganza> !
[15:20] <mbtamuli12> !
[15:20] <puiterwijk> next
[15:20] <jasonbraganza> puiterwijk - resources for dummies? gpg for idiots? like us :P
[15:21] <puiterwijk> jasonbraganza: I think kushal has some links there
[15:21] <kushal> jasonbraganza, I will share a few links later.
[15:21] <puiterwijk> Yep
[15:21] <jasonbraganza> thank you
[15:21] <puiterwijk> next
[15:21] <mbtamuli12> If I did a `gpg --send-keys` sometime ago when I was practicing these commands and I lost my private key, should I be worried that it's still out there, I don't even have the key ID now? It wasn't signed by anyone or I hadn't signed anyone's keys with it.
[15:21] <kushal> mbtamuli12, How did you loose the private key?
[15:21] <mbtamuli12> Some time ago means about a year ago. I don't remember when I set it to expire<eom>
[15:22] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[15:22] <mbtamuli12> kushal: I had formatted my laptop without taking backup.
[15:22] <puiterwijk> mbtamuli12: you should search on keys.fedoraproject.org for all email addresses you are still using. If it shows them, then yes, you've got some pain
[15:23] <puiterwijk> If it does show results for your email address, I'm hoping you added an expiration date, or you're going to have to convince everyone trying to encrypt messages to you to use the correct key
[15:23] <puiterwijk> next
[15:23] <sitlanigaurav[m]> What to do in case i forget my passphrase?<eom>
[15:23] <puiterwijk> sitlanigaurav[m]: hope you didn't use your key anywhere or sent it to a keyserver (or that you added an expiration date), and create a new key
[15:24] <puiterwijk> There is no way to recover a passphrase
[15:24] <mbtamuli12> !
[15:24] <puiterwijk> And do NOT run *any* program that says it can find a GPG key passphrase back. That's not possible without brute-forcing, for which there are no powerful enough computers
[15:24] <puiterwijk> next
[15:25] <mbtamuli12> pass.
[15:25] <puiterwijk> next
[15:25] <sitlanigaurav[m]> i didn't, just was curious to know if someone forgets it.<eom>
[15:25] <puiterwijk> sitlanigaurav[m]: ah, okay. Make sure you do not forget it :)
[15:25] <puiterwijk> (or hope that you had set an expiration date)
[15:26] <neer> !
[15:26] <puiterwijk> next
[15:26] <neer> Okay how do i see my public key, and how to send it?
[15:27] <puiterwijk> neer: gpg --list-keys to see it. Then you can use "gpg --armor --export >mykey" to get your key in a file, which other people can then use with "gpg --import hiskey"
[15:27] <sitlanigaurav[m]> neer: already answered, just scroll up
[15:28] <neer> missed it, thanks
[15:28] <puiterwijk> Note: I'm going to keep this open for about 2 more minutes. After that, I will still stay around, but will also need to focus on other things
[15:28] <puiterwijk> next
[15:28] <kushal> puiterwijk, Thank you for this great session :)
[15:29] <kushal> puiterwijk, I hope people will be able to start using gpg more in daily life.
[15:29] <deepika> !
[15:29] <sitlanigaurav[m]> puiterwijk: It was amazing :), thank you!
[15:29] <bhavin192> puiterwijk, now it's brain storming for us :) :P
[15:29] <puiterwijk> next
[15:29] <kushal> Q: Who all here uses a mail client to read/write emails?
[15:29] <deepika> what difference is created in a file with clearsigned , encrypt, decrypt, verify commands
[15:29] <apoorv> Me
[15:30] <kushal> Example: thunderbird.
[15:30] <poojaencoded> !
[15:30] <sitlanigaurav[m]> kushal: me
[15:30] <championshuttler> me thunderbird
[15:30] <ghishadow> puiterwijk, thanks for great session, learned many things :)
[15:30] <mbtamuli12> !
[15:30] <atultherajput> !
[15:30] <avik> I
[15:30] <puiterwijk> deepika: clearsign is a message that is signed, but still readably, verify makes sure that the message was signed by a specific person. encrypt makes it so only the recipient can read the file, for which they use decrypt
[15:30] <ikshitij> Thunderbird
[15:30] <NikitaK3> Amazing session! Thank you puiterwijk!
[15:30] <puiterwijk> So clearsign and verify belong together, just like encrypt and decrypt
[15:31] <deepika> puiterwijk and signed.asc why it gave your id's at first
[15:31] <puiterwijk> I need to get on other things for a bit, but Kushal can answer some questions. I will stay around for if he doesn't know, or you can always send me a question (just might take a bit for me to reply)
[15:31] <puiterwijk> deepika: because I had signed that message with my key
[15:32] <deepika> thanks puiterwijk for this session :)
[15:32] <kushal> So, who all are not using any mail client? Please say "me" if you are not using a mail client

[15:33] <yurii> me
[15:34] <kushal> This will teach you how to use things you learned today in the mails

[15:35] <ahole[m]> Me
[15:35] <kushal> Also read everything from https://ssd.eff.org/
[15:35] <kushal> That is a must read for everyone.
[15:35] <ahole[m]> !
[15:35] <maxking> kushal: http://www.claws-mail.org/ is also a very good alternative :)
[15:35] <kushal> Once, you configured your mail client with your key, start doing clearsigning your mails.
[15:36] <kushal> maxking, yes, and we can not support everyone together.
[15:36] <ahole[m]> Why use a mail client as per whatever knowledge I have mail clients are only needed in case of systems that hop between online and offline?
[15:36] <kushal> I will start a thread in the list about the same.

[15:37] <mbtamuli12> puiterwijk: https://www.paulfurley.com/gpg-for-humans-protecting-your-primary-key/ In this article, the person advises to create a subkey with Sign capability and do all "every day" tasks with this subkey and protect the primary key which has both Sign and Certify capability by not using it in "every day" tasks. Would you recommend this way?

[15:38] <atultherajput> What i am supposed to do with public key which i had distributed to others if i lost my private key?
[15:38] <poojaencoded> okay kushal
[15:38] <kushal> atultherajput, nothing you can do.
[15:38] <kushal> next
[15:38] <puiterwijk> mbtamuli12: yes, I would recommend it that way, but that was too complicated for here for today
[15:38] <kushal> next
[15:38] <jasonbraganza> I have two machines running two different operating system, but using the same email id.
[15:39] <jasonbraganza> Different gpg keys needed?

[15:39] <mbtamuli12> puiterwijk: I understand. Thanks.
[15:40] <Ani> !
[15:41] <kushal> jasonbraganza, you can use the same key
[15:41] <jasonbraganza> thank you
[15:42] <kushal> Remember two things
[15:42] <ikshitij> !
[15:42] <kushal> Do not loose your private key, nor the passphrase.
[15:42] <kushal> Do not share your private key.
[15:43] <kushal> There are various ways of backing up keys, we will learn slowly about those.
[15:45] <kushal> next
[15:45] <kang0> How to run Linux in Linux using copy and pasting folders
[15:45] <Ani> Done
[15:45] <kushal> next
[15:45] <ikshitij> As I can see on keys.fedoraproject.org for your email ID, there are list of few people ! Is this a list of trusted People ?
[15:46] <kushal> ikshitij, those people signed my key.
[15:46] <kushal> next
[15:46] <jasonbraganza> Excuse me folks. & Good night :)

[13:33] <kushal> So welcome siddhesh to #dgplug
[13:34] <kushal> He is a regular member anyway :)
[13:34] <jasonbraganza> Hi siddhesh!
[13:34] <kushal> But, he is also the upstream developer of glibc.
[13:34] <kushal> I am not going to tell you what is glibc, but passing the mike to siddhesh.
[13:34] <soumam007_> Soumam Banerjee
[13:34] <kushal> siddhesh, stage is yours :)
[13:34] <prokbird> kushal, please give permission

[13:34] <siddhesh> thank you kushal :)
[13:34] <siddhesh> hello everybody!

[13:35] <Phi_mb> Hello. :)
[13:35] <RIcharD_> Hello siddhesh
[13:35] <santoshShaw> Hello siddhesh:
[13:35] <ahole[m]> Hello siddhesh
[13:35] <deepika> Hi Siddhesh
[13:35] <championshuttler> Hello siddesh
[13:35] <skarpy> Hi
[13:35] <pr97> Hello siddhesh
[13:35] <siddhesh> So I am now going to spend the next hour or so boring you about my life and how I ended up being maintainer for glibc.
[13:35] <vaibhavlohani> Hi siddhesh
[13:35] <asraisingh> Hello siddhesh
[13:35] <kushal> next
[13:35] <kushal> siddhesh, Questions queue is also clear.
[13:35] <championshuttler> prokbird: no need to ask you can join and attend the session but first read previous logs, link is https://www.dgplug.org/irclogs/
[13:36] <siddhesh> I obviously won't write for the whole hour, I'll quickly recount how I ended up as a maintainer and then hopefully y'all will have questions
[13:36] <bhavin192> siddhesh, I always wanted to know that, from the day I met you :)
[13:36] <siddhesh> One of my major interests has been to try and grow more systems programmers in India
[13:36] <siddhesh> So I hope it inspires some poor soul to spend their nights and days hacking away at assembly and C.
[13:37] <siddhesh> Hopefully some of you may have read up on what glibc is, but if not, it is the library that provides C programming language runtime support.
[13:37] <siddhesh> Or in simpler terms, it is the library that has everything from printf and scanf to gethostbyname and strlen to sin and cos and so on.
[13:38] <siddhesh> Unless you're programming in golang (and even there you'll have exceptions) you're using glibc.
[13:38] <siddhesh> In the 2012-2015 time frame I was among the most prolific committers to the project.  That has reduced a bit now since my new (now old) job.
[13:39] <siddhesh> I do more release management and reviews now than actual patches, but I do write patches now and then :)
[13:39] <siddhesh> I still work on glibc today at Linaro, but it is specificaly for the aarch64 architecture (i.e. 64-bit ARM) for an upcoming Qualcomm server chip.
[13:39] <siddhesh> I also lead a toolchain team that does code optimizations for the aarch64 architecture, especially the upcoming server chip.
[13:40] <siddhesh> that is, massage assembly code so that it runs faster on these chips
[13:40] <siddhesh> Before I go into flashback mode, tech questions are OK, just that it's not the focus of my session.
[13:41] <siddhesh> Anyway, so a lot of people I meet today assume that I am the quintessential geek, raised from an IIT or NIT, making toy compilers and programming computers with ones and zeros.
[13:41] <siddhesh> But that is far from the truth. In fact my background is that of an ultra-typical middle/lower-middle class kid with an average education and opportunity.
[13:42] <siddhesh> I am the usual IIT-fail (practically everyone in my time was, even those who chose medicine in the end!) but instead of falling back to engineering, I fell further, into a B.Sc.
[13:42] <pr97_> Sorry, but i got disconnected, please someone pm me what i missed in the last 5 minutes :(
[13:42] <championshuttler> pr97: ok wait
[13:42] <poojaencoded> Roll call:poojaencoded
[13:42] <siddhesh> But the B.Sc. was a blessing in disguise, because that's how I discovered Free Software
[13:43] <siddhesh> and the idea that there's an OS other than Windows
[13:43] <siddhesh> I was introduced to Linux by my teacher in B.Sc., Abhijit Rao (@quasiabhi) who was the stereotypical FSF geek, including the beard
[13:43] <ravindra> Roll call Ravindra Lakal
[13:43] <siddhesh> he later went on to become one of the legendary hackers that wrote cleartrip
[13:44] <siddhesh> Anyway, I spent 3 days and nights (bunking college of course) just to install Debian woody. Trying to figure everything out by myself was quite an adventure.
[13:44] <siddhesh> "By myself" because I am a stubborn ass and I don't look up until I give up (which I rarely do) and that means I don't even ask questions during that time.
[13:45] <poojaencoded> sorry,i was also disconnected,please someone pm me from starting
[13:45] <CHOCOS> me too :(
[13:45] <siddhesh> That's not the best way to solve problems of course, and I am working on that.  But there are aspects of the stubbornness that have helped me.
[13:45] <siddhesh> I did succeed in installing Linux and using it and over the years, eliminated Windows from my family computer.
[13:46] <siddhesh> i.e., my mom and my sister both would use Linux.
[13:46] <siddhesh> The only blocker was a dialer program for Sify broadband because my mom (or my sis) could not use the terminal to login.
[13:46] <siddhesh> So I wrote one using reverse engineered specs on the internet.  It is called antidialer.
[13:46] <siddhesh> That was my first FOSS project, something I wrote myself and published
[13:47] <siddhesh> https://sourceforge.net/projects/antidialer/
[13:47] <siddhesh> I enjoyed writing this, but I was still a reluctant programmer, learning only enough programming to solve my problems and then promptly forgetting.
[13:48] <siddhesh> in a sense, I have not changed that aspect of me either, just ask kushal how long it took me to 'accept' python as an interesting programming language :)
[13:48] <siddhesh> all it took was a use case for it in the end, but it did take long :)
[13:49] <siddhesh> So I wasn't really immersed in technology in any sense, just using it to solve my problems.
[13:49] <ahole[m]> !
[13:49] <fxkundan> How did you get over that reluctant programmer thing
[13:49] <siddhesh> I was sold on the idea of Free software and the geek cred that using Linux had
[13:49] <siddhesh> next
[13:50] <ahole[m]> What was the use case that convinced you to learn python ?
[13:50] <siddhesh> fxkundan, I haven't, I still am very selfish about my use of computers.
[13:50] <fxkundan> !
[13:50] <siddhesh> ahole[m], I wrote it to do the microbenchmark framework in python
[13:50] <jasonbraganza> !
[13:50] <siddhesh> my first version was in perl and then when I wrote it in python it just seemed nicer
[13:51] <siddhesh> I was especially sold by the list comprehension and lambdas.  It is still my favourite bit of the language.
[13:51] <siddhesh> next
[13:51] <ashwanig> !
[13:51] <fxkundan> My question was already answered
[13:51] <siddhesh> next
[13:51] <jasonbraganza> when were the antidialer days? just trying to build up a timeframe
[13:51] <ahole[m]> Sorry for the annoying question what is a mircobenchmark framework?
[13:52] <siddhesh> jasonbraganza, I think around 2006, a bit before I graduated from MCA
[13:52] <jasonbraganza> thank you. think i saw it on a pcquest cd :) <eom>
[13:52] <siddhesh> ahole[m], it's a framework I wrote to test performance of functions in glibc
[13:53] <siddhesh> jasonbraganza, oh wow, I never knew it was used by people :P
[13:53] <siddhesh> next
[13:53] <ashwanig> Sometimes I think of an idea for solving problems, then I think it's unrealistic and give up - How can I correct this mindset? <eof>
[13:53] <ashwanig> *my problems
[13:54] <siddhesh> ashwanig, it's the give up bit.  Large problems always look unsolvable, it's their nature.
[13:54] <siddhesh> the idea is to keep trying to break it down.
[13:54] <siddhesh> and try to make incremental progress
[13:54] <santoshShaw> !
[13:54] <ashwanig> siddhesh, Thanks
[13:55] <Cyber_freak> !
[13:55] <siddhesh> ashwanig, and it really is the 'giving up' bit that is key.  If the problem is important enough to you, you won't give up.  So find a way to make the problem important to you.
[13:55] <siddhesh> that's how antidialer worked for me.  It was *my* problem.
[13:55] <siddhesh> next
[13:55] <santoshShaw> Do we need to understand the whole glibc library to start contributing <eof>
[13:56] <siddhesh> santoshShaw, nope.  Like I said, find something that bothers you and then break it down so that you target a specific part of glibc
[13:56] <santoshShaw> glibc is so huge
[13:56] <siddhesh> santoshShaw, I won't claim to understand all of glibc, and I don't think anybody in the glibc community would either.
[13:57] <Cyber_freak> How did you keep yourself motivated? I mean it's tough to work on something even if you love doing it.
[13:57] <siddhesh> for glibc or any large project, it is a piece at a time.  And they're well written enough that you can follow the trail
[13:57] <siddhesh> next
[13:57] <santoshShaw> Ok siddhesh:  I got my mentor as you
[13:57] <kushal> Cyber_freak, ask only when it is your turn.
[13:58] <Cyber_freak> really sorry kushal
[13:58] <siddhesh> Cyber_freak, it doesn't and there are often times when I am distracted and watching cat videos
[13:58] <Cyber_freak> won't happen again
[13:58] <siddhesh> but every so often I get a problem that bothers me enough
[13:58] <siddhesh> or a learning opportunity (or obsession) that grips me long enough
[13:58] <asraisingh> !
[13:58] <siddhesh> next
[13:58] <asraisingh> siddhesh, If I am trying to solving a problem by then how I get to know about the function and libraries available?
[13:59] <siddhesh> asraisingh, every library has a programming reference if that's what you're looking for.
[13:59] <siddhesh> asraisingh, for glibc there are the man pages
[14:00] <asraisingh> siddhesh, ok
[14:00] <asraisingh> thanks
[14:00] <siddhesh> all the functions in section 3 are C library functions (AFAIR) and those in 2 are syscalls, but they're also interposed by glibc
[14:00] <siddhesh> next
[14:00] <siddhesh> ok then, back to my script :D
[14:00] <siddhesh> So I wasn't really even as clued into tech as y'all are
[14:00] <siddhesh> I still remember the first (of only two) LUG Mumbai meetup that I went to, where Philip Tellis talked about the cvs versioning system.
[14:01] <siddhesh> I understood *nothing*.
[14:01] <siddhesh> Philip Tellis turns up again in the story, so stay tuned :)
[14:01] <siddhesh> I graduated from my B.Sc. and stood 2nd in my college, but did very badly in one paper - Systems Software :D
[14:01] <siddhesh> for those who are not in college, systems software is where we learn compilers, linkers and loaders
[14:01] <siddhesh> stuff I work on on a daily basis today :P
[14:02] <ahole[m]> "did very badly in one paper - Systems Software" okay this sounds more like me.
[14:02] <siddhesh> I didn't care though because my career path was well planned - MCA, get an IT job, become a Lead in 2 years and a Project Manager in 3-4 years and settle abroad
[14:02] <siddhesh> Sounds familiar? That's because this was probably the most common career path plan back then :)
[14:02] <siddhesh> Sure enough, I got into MCA and again found that programming was simple enough and nobody really cared about it
[14:02] <siddhesh> All that everyone cared about was 'Leadership Skills'.
[14:03] <siddhesh> I got into TCS (I can hear people who didn't read my bio gasping!) right out of campus and spent a great 2.5 years there.
[14:03] <siddhesh> That's right, my 2.5 years in TCS were quite good :)
[14:03] <siddhesh> I worked with a financial client and there was a lot of activity there, which meant I did some very involved work with C++, SQL, C, Lex, Yacc and heaven knows what else.
[14:03] <siddhesh> My exposure to Linux helped; I was at home on their HP-UX environment.
[14:03] <asraisingh> siddhesh, compilers is in my coming semester, means I have to give more time to it.
[14:03] <siddhesh> I didn't actually grok a lot of the stuff, but I understood enough to solve my problems.
[14:04] <siddhesh> I was top of heap there and it very quickly went into my head that I might be among the best programmers around.
[14:04] <siddhesh> I met my target of becoming a Lead in 2 years - I was made Module Lead of a sub-project.
[14:04] <siddhesh> Due to that and some changes in personal life, I ended up having evenings free.
[14:04] <siddhesh> I also started feeling a bit unchallenged technically.
[14:04] <siddhesh> Then came Philip Tellis again.
[14:04] <siddhesh> Philip is this quintessential geek of the 90s.
[14:04] <siddhesh> Brilliant programmer, always focused and extremely helpful.
[14:05] <siddhesh> He was one of the earliest employees at Yahoo! India, has had a couple of startups in the US and now works for Akamai.
[14:05] <siddhesh> He also co-wrote an instant messenger called Ayttm but had to stop working on it after joining Yahoo.
[14:05] <siddhesh> Conflict of interest - ayttm reversed engineered (the EULA forbids it) the yahoo messaging protocol.
[14:05] <siddhesh> ayttm: http://ayttm.sourceforge.net
[14:05] <siddhesh> In 2017 he asked on the LUG mumbai list if someone wanted to volunteer to port ayttm (a messaging client) to gtkv2.
[14:05] <siddhesh> 'How hard could it be?' I thought, and volunteered.
[14:05] <siddhesh> And then spent the next couple of weeks just trying to build ayttm using Philip's instructions!
[14:06] <siddhesh> My stubbornness eventually won and I steadily made progress and finished the port to gtk.
[14:06] <siddhesh> I continued and rewrote the IRC plugin, the MSN plugin, the yahoo plugin, redoing the UI and so on.
[14:06] <siddhesh> I spent every free moment there, nights, weekends, every minute.
[14:06] <siddhesh> I learned practically everything there was to about C programming there, but there was a bigger lesson there.
[14:06] <siddhesh> I learned that I was a terrible programmer.  I knew nothing.
[14:06] <siddhesh> That was an incredible wakeup call - learning just how bad a programmer I was.
[14:07] <siddhesh> One funny incident that reinforced this was when I found one old issue about a segfault in the ayttm issue list.
[14:07] <siddhesh> (I can't find the link to it unfortunately)
[14:07] <siddhesh> Philip had asked for a backtrace and the reporter had not responded.
[14:07] <siddhesh> I realized that the reporter was me from about a year ago!
[14:07] <siddhesh> I had not responded to Philip's request because I didn't know what a backtrace was and was too ashamed to ask!
[14:07] <siddhesh> Anyway, that anecdote aside, ayttm is also how I got a call for a job in Red Hat - for a technical support engineer.
[14:08] <siddhesh> My mother had taken that call from HR and told him off saying that her son was not interested in support, only development.
[14:08] <siddhesh> (My mother was a technical recruiter too, so she obviously 'knew' the value of development jobs over support jobs!)
[14:08] <siddhesh> It took another call from a guy who would end up being my manager (Mustafa) to convince me to interview for the job.
[14:08] <siddhesh> I finaly made it into the tech support team at RH and moved to Pune for the job.
[14:08] <siddhesh> That pretty much changed my life, because while TCS work was more challenging, I was learning the breadth and depth of the OS here.
[14:09] <siddhesh> I was *learning* here while I was solving problems at TCS, not necessarily learning anything new in technology.
[14:09] <siddhesh> I basically discovered the fun in learning here
[14:09] <siddhesh> I was still not content, because I wanted to be a devel guy at RH.
[14:09] <siddhesh> It was a bit ironic because I kinda hated RH before, being a Debian freak.  (trivia: my IRC nick then was debiansid)
[14:09] <siddhesh> But when I joined I saw what an open org RH was and the work culture there was very good
[14:10] <siddhesh> I wanted to be one of the devs that made an impact.  The only way I could do that was by plugging away at work.
[14:10] <siddhesh> This was easy because my natural stubbornness helped.
[14:10] <siddhesh> I was a desktop support engineer, so I would troubleshoot X, gnome, KDE, etc.
[14:10] <siddhesh> But since I was among the few people in the tech support team who could read code, I would get quite a few tickets that needed code reading.
[14:10] <siddhesh> Also segfaults - those became my speciality in the end.
[14:11] <siddhesh> I could have done a high level analysis and sent the tickets to L3 engineers, which was the process defined.
[14:11] <siddhesh> But I would spend nights and weekends trying to debug problems and come up with patches.
[14:11] <siddhesh> Some would say that I was investing too much in a company that cared only about its bottom lines, but I would argue that I was investing in my career.
[14:11] <siddhesh> and luckily for me, I could find the time.
[14:11] <siddhesh> Thanks to all of the patches I wrote I found a place in L3 engineering soon.
[14:12] <siddhesh> I ended up in the Toolchain group mainly because I had done quite a bit of problem analysis in that area.
[14:12] <siddhesh> Mind you, problem analysis - I never really wrote an original patch.
[14:12] <siddhesh> Or rather, I failed to write one every single time I tried :)
[14:12] <siddhesh> One good thing about being in tech support and looking at all those core dumps was that I became very good at reading code.
[14:13] <siddhesh> Even today, it is the one skill I cherish.
[14:13] <siddhesh> The other skill was a deep understanding of how programs run on a machine - I learned that in tech support too
[14:13] <siddhesh> imagine trying to figure out what is happening on someone else's computer based on just a core dump and some logs!
[14:13] <siddhesh> In fact, it almost became an obsession, understanding how any program executed on the machine.
[14:14] <siddhesh> This obsession was far harder than the earlier ones - it took over 6 months of constant rejections before my first patch to glibc finally landed upstream.
[14:14] <siddhesh> Rejections were fun too - Andreas Schwab was the glibc maintainer in RH at that time and he would respond with one liners.
[14:14] <siddhesh> "You've got it the other way around", he would say.
[14:14] <siddhesh> I would then have to sit for a couple of days to try and figure out what he meant :P
[14:14] <siddhesh> Tremendous learning, but I almost gave up, given that I was making faster progress in other areas, like qpid and base os.
[14:15] <siddhesh> I was one of two people in RH who understood the internals of ksh, so I could have easily made the base os engineering team.
[14:15] <siddhesh> But I was obsessed with toolchains and I knew at that time gcc was beyond me
[14:15] <siddhesh> so was glibc, but it seemed closer than gcc :)
[14:15] <siddhesh> The first glibc patch was a huge confidence booster though, and it encouraged me to continue trying harder.
[14:16] <siddhesh> In the meantime, another interesting (and lucky for me) turn of events happened - Ulrich Drepper, then maintainer of glibc, left RH and ended his contributions to glibc.
[14:16] <siddhesh> For those who don't know, Uli was the major contributor to glibc for decades and his attitude repelled a lot of contributors, almost killing the community.
[14:17] <siddhesh> After his exit, a community started forming around it with the original author of glibc (Roland McGrath), Carlos O'Donell, Joseph Myers and a few others rebooting the project.
[14:17] <siddhesh> This also left a gap in the RH toolchain team and they were looking for a glibc engineer to fill the gap.
[14:17] <siddhesh> Jeff Law (those who don't know, he is the demi-god of the gcc community) was holding fort with glibc while they looked for a replacement.
[14:18] <siddhesh> I had become quite hands-on with the code base and was helping Jeff in whatever limited capacity I could from L3.
[14:18] <siddhesh> However when I saw the opening, I dropped him an email and asked him if I qualified.
[14:18] <siddhesh> He said "why not!" and I applied, thinking that the worst that could happen was that I would get rejected.
[14:18] <siddhesh> Nisha (my wife) was instrumental in that thought, including the one where I made the move to RH.
[14:18] <siddhesh> I studied compilers furiously for the interview and ended up getting that job.
[14:19] <siddhesh> I also realized during the interview that I actually *just knew* a lot of things from having worked on them and solving problems
[14:19] <siddhesh> the reading I did wasn't very helpful, just aided my knowledge
[14:19] <siddhesh> Anyway, because of my cheap Indian salary, they could afford to hire another glibc engineer - Carlos O'Donell.
[14:19] <siddhesh> That started the best 2.5 years of my career.
[14:20] <siddhesh> Carlos and I became a sort of dream team (and great friends now, even after leaving RH) where we helped rebuild the glibc community.
[14:20] <siddhesh> Actually Carlos did most of the community building work with Joseph Myers and Roland, but hey, I think I can sneak in some credit ;)
[14:20] <siddhesh> The entire toolchain team at RH was just incredible, each with their own specialty.  That is where I learned a lot, just listening to all the conversations.
[14:20] <siddhesh> From concurrency discussions with Torvald Riegel to TLS stuff with Alex Oliva
[14:21] <siddhesh> In fact, back in 2013 we were at a conference in Mountain View and Torvald and Alex argued about something (I can't remember what) the whole week!
[14:21] <siddhesh> and I remember that being a very enlightening week for me because I learned a lot from their arguments.
[14:22] <siddhesh> Throughout the 2.5 years at RH I realized that one thing was constant:
[14:22] <siddhesh> every time I learned something new, there was something else waiting to be discovered
[14:22] <siddhesh> so the more I knew, the less I knew.
[14:22] <siddhesh> The more I learn about these increasingly complicated machines, the more I realize how much I don't know.
[14:23] <siddhesh> I guess the takeaway from this is that it's easy to look at me or any other maintainer and think that we can do no wrong.
[14:23] <siddhesh> But we do, all the time.
[14:23] <siddhesh> The difference is that we fix our mistakes and learn from them.
[14:23] <siddhesh> And of course the fact that we have just managed to fail more than others :)
[14:24] <siddhesh> So right now my struggle is with gcc, the unknown frontier
[14:24] <ahole[m]> !
[14:24] <siddhesh> I'm continuously failing there, but only those who know I'm working on it can see that unfortunately
[14:25] <siddhesh> anyway, that was my story, so I'm open for questions, tech, non-tech, all types of questions are OK!
[14:25] <siddhesh> next
[14:25] <ahole[m]> Now you have shifted to gcc from glibc?
[14:25] <CYber_freak_> !
[14:26] <siddhesh> not shifted really, just added an interest.  There are optimizations I can hand-write in glibc, but then there are optimizations that gcc would do for me.  I am trying to explore how I can make gcc do that.
[14:26] <santoshShaw> !
[14:26] <siddhesh> and miserably failing right now, but some day I'll succeed :P
[14:27] <siddhesh> next
[14:28] <ahole[m]> siddhesh: Failing is not really a factor. Even I start looking for projects where I can contribute in terms of code and eventually end up doing nothing at all.
[14:28] <mriyam> !
[14:28] <CYber_freak_> What advice would you give to someone starting out pretty late , final year student :-P with an average programming skills but with the whole idea of open source , thanks to those meetup groups.
[14:28] <ahole[m]> siddhesh:  I guess you are in a better position.
[14:28] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:28] <siddhesh> ahole[m], I think that has to do with the 'scratch your itch' bit.  It's all good trying to find a project to contribute to, but you won't end up doing much if you don't have skin in the game.
[14:29] <siddhesh> antidialer was an itch for me that I scratched.
[14:29] <siddhesh> ayttm was a work item that philip tossed and I grabbed.
[14:29] <siddhesh> and then once I grabbed it, I had to work on it - that's where obsession took over.
[14:30] <siddhesh> we toss these kinds of problems in all the time
[14:30] <siddhesh> like the pthread docs problem I keep mentioning to everyone who then promptly starts avoiding me :)
[14:30] <siddhesh> they key is to grab these opportunities because without them you'll be stuck waiting for that itch to scratch.
[14:30] <siddhesh> next
[14:31] <santoshShaw> have you created/added any new library in glibc?<eof>
[14:31] <santoshShaw> What about pthread docs?<eof>
[14:32] <siddhesh> no new libraries (because they're an ABI event that we would usually keep to a minimum).  but I have added a couple of new features - microbenchmarks to measure function performance and lately, tunables to tweak settings in glibc.
[14:32] <CYber_freak_> !
[14:32] <siddhesh> to mention a couple - I've worked on a bunch of other subsystems over time from math (multiple precision math performance) to malloc and nscd.
[14:33] <santoshShaw> siddhesh: what is nscd?
[14:33] <siddhesh> the pthread docs are mostly non-existent.  There's a glibc manual online that should have a description of all the pthread functions but it doesn't
[14:33] <siddhesh> We need volunteers to write documentation for it based on their reading of the glibc pthread implementation.
[14:34] <siddhesh> nscd is name server caching daemon.  google will help you understand better what it is :)
[14:34] <siddhesh> next
[14:34] <mriyam> "Mind you, problem analysis - I never really wrote an original patch." What did this mean?
[14:34] <siddhesh> oh, it meant that I had looked at tickets, found out what was wrong but did not know how to fix it.
[14:35] <mriyam> So what did you do then?
[14:35] <mriyam> To help with the ticket.
[14:35] <ashwanig> !
[14:35] <siddhesh> I had accomplished the bit about udnerstanding the problem, but with a complex code base such as glibc, it is often hard to come up with a fix given the various tradeoffs one may have to make.
[14:35] <siddhesh> I wrote up a detailed description of what I found and how I found it.  And then left it to engineering to decide what to do.
[14:36] <siddhesh> https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1190
[14:36] <siddhesh> here's an example of how even a one line change in glibc could have huge implications.
[14:36] <siddhesh> It was one of the earliest fixes I had posted and had to give up because the problem was way beyond my scope of knowledge then.
[14:37] <siddhesh> next
[14:37] <jasonbraganza> What advice would you give to a even late starter a 38 year old whoâs just started learning programming basics and wants to use software programming as his next career change? :P
[14:37] <siddhesh> heh, don't lose hope, you're not *that* old :)
[14:37] <siddhesh> at 35 I am among the younger gcc/glibc programmers
[14:37] <jasonbraganza> :)
[14:38] <jasonbraganza> the journey you described - 10-12 years?
[14:38] <siddhesh> age is really just a number when it comes to programming. If anything, you're much better placed to understand subtleties of programming complex systems
[14:38] <siddhesh> I started my career in 2006, but I started hacking on glibc in 2011 or so
[14:38] <siddhesh> so about 6-7 years
[14:39] <siddhesh> 6-7 years for toolchains that is
[14:39] <siddhesh> next
[14:39] <jasonbraganza> thank you :)
[14:39] <CYber_freak_> Same question :-) as jasonbraganza but I am a final year student and learning to write code efficiently and grasping programming fundamentals.
[14:39] <poojaencoded> !
[14:39] <CYber_freak_> so I guess you already answered it :-)
[14:40] <siddhesh> I am of a slightly different belief there; I'd say write code to solve your problems first and then look at how you can improve it to make it efficient, beautiful, etc.
[14:40] <siddhesh> over time, the beauty and efficiency will come in naturally, but if you make that a focus too early you'll lose sight of the goal.
[14:40] <mriyam> !
[14:41] <siddhesh> programming, hacking, etc. is an interest, not a goal.  Goals are what you could use programming to achieve.
[14:41] <siddhesh> next
[14:41] <CYber_freak_> thank you : -)
[14:41] <ashwanig> Can you share some tips on reading code or some difficulties you faced while learning to read code? <eof>
[14:42] <siddhesh> Oh the biggest difficulty usually is trying to figure out where to start
[14:42] <im_mohsin> !
[14:42] <siddhesh> however it's a bit easier with open source because there's usually a pattern in how code is configured and built.
[14:42] <deepika> !
[14:42] <siddhesh> as for trying to figure out where to start, the problem you're trying to solve should tell you that.
[14:43] <siddhesh> Look for the offending function/file and then start backtracking from there to main()
[14:43] <siddhesh> or whatever the equivalent of entry point in your programming language
[14:43] <siddhesh> it's a slow and often frustrating grind but eventually in some years you'll find yourself understanding patterns of almost completely alien code before you've read a couple of files.
[14:44] <siddhesh> it'll take years though :)
[14:44] <ashwanig> should I use debugger while reading code?
[14:44] <siddhesh> next
[14:44] <poojaencoded> what advice  would you give to a final year student who little bit about programming and haven't contribute anything  for open source and don't know more about it
[14:44] <siddhesh> ashwanig, oh yes, extensively, if that's how it works for you
[14:44] <ashwanig> siddhesh, okay, thanks :)
[14:45] <poojaencoded> but want to learn python and want to contribute
[14:45] <siddhesh> poojaencoded, hang out on these channels and mailing lists, go to meetups and workshops, look out for maintainers looking for volunteers to work on their project.
[14:45] <vaibhavlohani> !
[14:45] <kishore> !
[14:46] <siddhesh> if you have a maintainer asking for help, half of your battle is won because (s)he will have an interest in making sure you succeed.
[14:46] <siddhesh> next
[14:46] <mriyam> "It was one of the earliest fixes I had posted and had to give up because the problem was way beyond my scope of knowledge then."
[14:46] <mriyam> Did you give up on that issue? When do you know when to give up?
[14:46] <siddhesh> I gave up because I did not understand even a single line of the discussion that happened on the mailing list in response to my patch :)
[14:47] <siddhesh> I had other tickets to get to because of which I had to put it on the backburner
[14:47] <siddhesh> and then when I finally got to the point of understanding what was required to fix it, I realized that it is not worth the effort.
[14:48] <siddhesh> next
[14:48] <mriyam> Thanks for answering questions that may have sounded silly. <eom>
[14:48] <im_mohsin> siddhesh, There are lots of resources to learn anything and its overwhelming for newbies. What is your single most valuable piece of advice on learning something new like a pattern you followed to master something?(Not just related to Technology)
[14:48] <vaishali_> !
[14:49] <mbuf> !
[14:49] <siddhesh> im_mohsin, With respect to technology, solving bugs.  The analogue in life in general is finding something that bothers you enough that you want to invest yourself in fixing it.
[14:49] <siddhesh> If you're not the kind that can read the OS Tanenbaum book from end to end, then your approach should be to pick problems to solve.
[14:50] <siddhesh> that automatically reduces the surface of the technology (or problem statement) you have to cover
[14:50] <siddhesh> next
[14:50] <deepika> What would you suggest ,to learn things on the go with the problem or to first get some understanding of related concepts a bit ,does it effect hacking and the productivity as you tried both in two phases of your life ?
[14:51] <im_mohsin> siddhesh, thanks :)
[14:51] <siddhesh> deepika, the former helps in most cases, but there are times when you need to keep the computer aside and do some serious reading.
[14:51] <siddhesh> In fact I have a story about that :)
[14:52] <siddhesh> back in 2012-13, I did my first big project, which was to try and speed up the slow path of all of the math functions.
[14:52] <siddhesh> However, I had no clue how those functions are written and if you look at their implementation (I've added some comments in some functions now but...) they're ugly and arcane
[14:52] <asraisingh> !
[14:52] <siddhesh> because they were written by mathematicians in IBM
[14:53] <siddhesh> and they were written with the IBM powerpc processors
[14:53] <siddhesh> so I had to get an ACM subscription and hunt for a paper by Schmuel and Gal upon which the pow function implementation was based
[14:53] <siddhesh> and then read up on how math functions are written in general
[14:54] <siddhesh> (i.e. argument range reduction, table lookup, etc.)
[14:54] <siddhesh> that was a very frustrating 1-2 months of my life because I was used to problem solving, not just reading like that
[14:54] <siddhesh> but at the same time I was doing math again, which helped tide through it.
[14:55] <siddhesh> Similar situation last month, when I have had to read about some CPU hardware prefetcher before I could even touch any code
[14:55] <siddhesh> throughout that 1-2 months I felt like I was going to be kicked out of my job because I had not written any code
[14:56] <siddhesh> but the end result was good - I improved pow 8 times and some other functions by similar factors
[14:56] <jasonbraganza> hoo boy!
[14:56] <siddhesh> it wasn't enough though because those paths were about 1000x slower :P
[14:57] <siddhesh> so yeah, both approaches are valid, you have to decide which one to take and often you'll take to wrong path and then return to take the correct one.
[14:57] <siddhesh> next
[14:57] <vaibhavlohani> How would you compare system level programming with application level programming ?
[14:57] <deepika> siddhesh: :)
[14:57] <siddhesh> vaibhavlohani, there are different problems to solve in both layers
[14:58] <siddhesh> at the application level, you assume that the computer is a sane and ideal computing machine and focus on the business problem
[14:58] <siddhesh> you assume that the compiler produces ideal code, the runtimes are perfectly tuned, memory systems work well, etc.
[14:58] <siddhesh> With system programming the problem statement is the computer itself
[14:59] <siddhesh> i.e. how do I eek out the last bit of performance form this CPU+caches+memory+disk combination?
[14:59] <siddhesh> how do I get this new device working?
[14:59] <siddhesh> how do I isolate environment X from environment Y?
[15:00] <siddhesh> so basically application programming looks up at businesses and systems programming looks down at the computer.
[15:00] <siddhesh> This also brings another interesting distinction between them
[15:01] <siddhesh> the problem domain for application programs can be made limited (except for things like SAP) and due to that the complexity can be layered more efficiently
[15:01] <siddhesh> with systems however, you're often making huge amounts of tradeoffs at every level and despite the tradeoffs, trying to equally good (or equally bad, depending on your mood that day) to all applications that use your services.
[15:01] <siddhesh> next
[15:02] <kishore> How much time does it take to learn debugging ? Is there a quick way to learn debugging ?
[15:02] <vaibhavlohani> Thanks siddhesh .
[15:02] <siddhesh> kishore, years :)
[15:02] <siddhesh> and you never quite 'learn' it :)
[15:02] <kishore> ;)
[15:02] <kishore> Alright, thanks
[15:02] <siddhesh> kishore, for a less snarky answer - debugging is less about the tools and more about imagination
[15:03] <siddhesh> kishore, you can learn tools in days or weeks, but you will have to keep debugging different kinds of problems to actually arrive at different strategies to tackle problems
[15:03] <siddhesh> and developing that can take years
[15:04] <siddhesh> the 'good debugging skills' problem is similar to the 'good programming skills' problem, they're both never realy possible :)
[15:04] <siddhesh> trivia: some of the best debuggers are usually good security experts, because security experts are basically people who are good at finding bugs
[15:04] <siddhesh> next
[15:05] <vaishali_> Siddhesh, not sure if this is a relevant question for a glibc maintainer but i'm just going ahead with this as you mentioned your love for system programming. :) Have you tried Rust? If yes then, what are your views on it [specifically it's memory management] as someone who has years of experience with system level stuff?
[15:05] <siddhesh> vaishali_, I haven't actually tried rust for reasons I mentioned earlier - I have never had a use for it.
[15:06] <siddhesh> I've heard good things about it though
[15:06] <siddhesh> in general I don't love or hate any programming languages.  I am comfortable with some and I like some constructs in some programming languages
[15:06] <siddhesh> but that doesn't translate to any kind of unconditional love
[15:06] <siddhesh> it's mostly the case of the right tool for the job
[15:07] <siddhesh> I've done ARM assembly programming though and I can tell you I find it cleaner than x86 assembly.
[15:07] <siddhesh> but if I had an x86 problem to solve, I wouldn't think twice before diving into it
[15:08] <siddhesh> next
[15:08] <mbuf> siddhesh, is there anything that you don't like about F/OSS?
[15:08] <vaishali_> siddhesh, Ok. Sounds reasonable. Thanks!
[15:08] <siddhesh> mbuf, haha, bait!
[15:09] <siddhesh> mbuf, I am not very fond of copyright assignments
[15:09] <mbuf> siddhesh, we have to live with it though
[15:09] <mbuf> siddhesh, :)
[15:10] <siddhesh> mbuf, I think we can live without it; it's something that michael kerrisk convinced me of a couple of years ago
[15:10] <vaibhavlohani> !
[15:10] <siddhesh> i.e. court cases have been won and gpl has been enforced in courts without needing copyright assignment
[15:11] <mbuf> siddhesh, mostly for another day's discussion; but, enforcing copyright has helped
[15:11] <mbuf> <eom>
[15:11] <siddhesh> It's arguably easier for the FSF, but it's just a personal disagreement I grudgingly live with because of my interest in the project
[15:11] <mbuf> siddhesh, okay
[15:11] <siddhesh> mbuf, yeah, it's a long discussion :)
[15:11] <siddhesh> next
[15:11] <asraisingh> siddhesh, answered. Thanks
[15:11] <siddhesh> ok
[15:11] <siddhesh> next
[15:11] <mbuf> later
[15:12] <vaibhavlohani> As you mentioned you sometimes spent days or even weeks in figuring out problems, how did you deal with deadlines?
[15:12] <siddhesh> vaibhavlohani, working nights and weekends helped :)
[15:13] <siddhesh> in many cases for work related stuff I would pass problems on to L3 (which relaxes my deadlines) and then continue working on it whenever I had time
[15:13] <siddhesh> this was especially the case for many of the ksh problems because there was only one other guy who would pick at them and he would often be busy with something else :)
[15:14] <siddhesh> vaibhavlohani, but yeah, sleeping 3 hours a day, spending weekends hacking, etc. was how I dealt with it
[15:14] <siddhesh> I don't recommend it, but given the limitations of the system there's not much else that can be done
[15:14] <siddhesh> and TBH, I should have invested all this time when I was in college, when I was busy goofing off
[15:15] <siddhesh> next
[15:15] <vaibhavlohani> When time is less, do you prefer getting things done on time or getting them done the right way ?
[15:16] <siddhesh> vaibhavlohani, I usually try to find a middle ground and if there is none then first on time and then a second iteration to get it right.
[15:16] <siddhesh> you miss deadlines and you lose the confidence of your manager/customer, so that's the first thing to manage
[15:17] <vaibhavlohani> siddhesh, thanks :)
[15:17] <siddhesh> you're welcome
[15:17] <siddhesh> any more questions?
[15:18] <kushal> siddhesh, queue is empty :)
[15:18] <siddhesh> good, so I guess we are done here :)
[15:18] <kushal> siddhesh, Thank you :)
[15:18] <cran-cg>  !
[15:18] <siddhesh> ah, the latecomer!
[15:18] <kushal> siddhesh, you have the last one :)
[15:18] <siddhesh> next
[15:18] <siddhesh> next
[15:18] <kushal> siddhesh, he does not know how type !
[15:18] <cran-cg> !
[15:18] <kushal> siddhesh, not your or batul's fault.
[15:18] <siddhesh> cran-cg, looks like you put a space before !
[15:18] <siddhesh> next
[15:19] <kushal> * how to
[15:19] <poojaencoded> !
[15:19] <cran-cg> How and where should we contact you for further guidance ?
[15:20] <bhavin192> cran-cg, he is active here
[15:20] <kushal> cran-cg, there is an IRC channel #dgplug
[15:20] <siddhesh> siddhesh AT gotplt DOT org if you want to email me
[15:20] <siddhesh> and I'm usually here on #dgplug
[15:20] <siddhesh> or @siddhesh_p on twitter in case you want to see cat videos I retweet :P
[15:20] <siddhesh> next
[15:20] <poojaencoded> siddhesh,firstly i started  java,it is awesome language.But while solving problems i got error and stuck in there packages and leave it ,then i switched to python and again while solving  problems and got error and get demotivated and i quit,nowadays i am doing nothing with programming languages :(
[15:21] <cran-cg> Thanks siddhesh kushal and bhavin192 :)
[15:21] <poojaencoded> what to do ?
[15:21] <siddhesh> poojaencoded, that is normal and that's how I used to deal with things in college.
[15:21] <poojaencoded> :(
[15:21] <siddhesh> poojaencoded, but that was because I was not personally invested in solving those problems
[15:22] <siddhesh> so imagine if your job was to fix it and you'd lose your job if you could not come up with something
[15:22] <poojaencoded> and only one month left for placement in my college
[15:22] <siddhesh> that becomes a motivator.  I have an intrinsic motivator that says "Oh you can't understand this?  Oh you're so stupid!"
[15:22] <siddhesh> and then I have to go and try to prove it wrong :P
[15:23] <siddhesh> poojaencoded, placements have nothing to do with this.  you need to find your motivator
[15:24] <siddhesh> poojaencoded, I was trying to think of a motivation for you but TBH I don't know.  You'll have to find your own.
[15:24] <poojaencoded> TBH?
[15:24] <siddhesh> To Be Honest
[15:25] <kushal> To be honest.
[15:25] <jasonbraganza> to be honest
[15:25] <poojaencoded> okay
[15:25] <gauravsitlani> poojaencoded, i have seen people getting placed who don't even know much coding ( not demoralizing you ), don't worry about it.
[15:25] <siddhesh> poojaencoded, keep plugging at it.  Catch hold of one project and try to complete at least one task.  That euphoria will hopefully take you through the next one.
[15:26] <jasonbraganza> âI did not understand even a single line of the discussionâ - so Iâm not the only one, siddhesh :)
[15:26] <ikshitij> gauravsitlani: true that !
[15:26] <siddhesh> jasonbraganza, oh yeah, bouncers are usually all over the place.
[15:26] <poojaencoded> i am not worried about my placements,because i want to do higher studies
[15:26] <siddhesh> I recently discovered that something that I was talking about went bouncer to someone who has about 20 years of experience in toolchain
[15:27] <siddhesh> it just happened to be something I knew and he didn't
[15:27] <ikshitij> siddhesh: the 'motivator' word, Sometime it could be you yourself ! Right ?
[15:27] <siddhesh> ikshitij, yeah it could, but I've found the "you can do it" bit often only works in movies ;)
[15:28] <siddhesh> but yeah, it does work for some
[15:28] <siddhesh> OK, any other last minute questions?
[15:28] <ikshitij> siddhesh: :)

[13:30] <kushal> :)
[13:30] <kushal> next
[13:30] <kushal> j4v4m4n, the stage is yours, you can take questions anytime by typing next.
[13:30] <mayur01> Roll call : Mayur khomane
[13:31] <singh123> Roll call : Amarjeet Singh
[13:31] <j4v4m4n> I'll start with a brief introduction about myself
[13:32] <j4v4m4n> I'm a Debian Developer and Freelance Free Software consultant based in Kerala
[13:32] <j4v4m4n> I maintain packages like gitlab, diaspora for debian and in that process I also maintain many nodejs/javascript tools as any web app needs javascript for front end
[13:33] <championshuttler> Roll Call: Shivam Singhal
[13:33] <j4v4m4n> I like to mentor new people to start contribuing to Free Software and take sessions in different places.
[13:34] <j4v4m4n> I'm also an advocate for privacy and part of the teams that run services like poddery.com, diasp.in, git.fosscommunity.in etc
[13:35] <j4v4m4n> Right now I'm using an app called riot (see riot.im) to connect to IRC
[13:36] <j4v4m4n> it is built on matrix protocol which is similar to IRC in purpose, ie, for real time chat, but has many nice features like a cbuilt-in bouner which lets you read messages even if you go offline, end to end encryption, voice and video etc
[13:36] <j4v4m4n> we could start our discussion with matrix and riot
[13:39] <j4v4m4n> you can read more about it from https://pad.disroot.org/p/matrix_en
[13:39] <j4v4m4n> and I'd like to take questions from you now
[13:39] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:39] <soumam007> !
[13:40] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:40] <soumam007> can you tell a bit more about matrix protocol
[13:40] <ahole[m]> !
[13:41] <pr97> !
[13:41] <j4v4m4n> the basic idea is to have decentralized communications
[13:41] <Vamsi_> Roll call: Vamsi Krishna
[13:42] <j4v4m4n> if you look at WhatsApp, Telegram etc, all of them are centralized, meaning one company provides all the service
[13:42] <joyhimanshu> roll call: Himanshu Awasthi
[13:42] <j4v4m4n> we don't have choice of providers
[13:42] <j4v4m4n> if you compare the situation with mobile sim cards or email, you can understand the difference
[13:43] <j4v4m4n> you can get sim card from any company or sign up for email from many different providers
[13:44] <j4v4m4n> also both client and server is Free Software here
[13:44] <j4v4m4n> for WhatsApp both are proprietary, for Telegram, client is Free Software
[13:44] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:44] <ahole[m]> Isn't riot build on to of matrix if i am not wrong ?
[13:44] <ahole[m]> a/to/top
[13:44] <ahole[m]> s/to/top
[13:44] <championshuttler> !
[13:45] <j4v4m4n> ahole: yes, riot app uses matrix protocol
[13:45] <j4v4m4n> you can use any other app as well
[13:45] <j4v4m4n> for example purple-matrix is a project to add matrix protocol support to pidgin
[13:46] <j4v4m4n> it already works with basic features, but it still needs more features to be really useable
[13:46] <j4v4m4n> if any of you are looking to work on a project, I suggest you consider purple matrix
[13:46] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:47] <pr97> I didn't understand how we can read messages even if we go offline?
[13:47] <soumam007> j4v4m4n, thanks
[13:47] <j4v4m4n> pr97: do you know about services like irccloud.com?
[13:48] <pr97> j4v4m4n,  no
[13:48] <j4v4m4n> in IRC, it is called a bouncer
[13:48] <j4v4m4n> you will connect to IRC from a server that is always online
[13:48] <j4v4m4n> and then you connect to your bouncer from your desktop/mobile
[13:49] <abhinavshirur> !
[13:49] <jasonbraganza> !
[13:49] <j4v4m4n> so even if your desktop/phone goes offline, your bounser will collect your messages
[13:49] <j4v4m4n> in matrix server, this is built-in, by default
[13:49] <theparadoxer02> Roll Call: Mannu Gupta
[13:49] <j4v4m4n> your matrix server will keep your messages even when you go offline
[13:50] <j4v4m4n> and when you come back on line, the server will deliver you the messages it collected on behalf of you
[13:50] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:50] <championshuttler> why there is [m] at the end of the nicks with riot generally? is it represent matix? but not in your nick
[13:51] <deepika> !
[13:51] <championshuttler> s/matix/matrix
[13:51] <ashwanig> championshuttler, We can change our nick
[13:51] <j4v4m4n> championshuttler: by default matrix adds a [m] at the end but you can change it
[13:51] <j4v4m4n> I have changed it, many have not changed I guess
[13:52] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:52] <abhinavshirur> A part of championshuttler's question- How did you manage to remove [m] from your username? I had searched for it but didn't find any solution
[13:52] <SpEcHiDeR> https://gist.github.com/dikiaap/644e7901dde50dc865c3795f8ca5b65c
[13:53] <j4v4m4n> @SpEcHiDe: thanks! hope that answers the question
[13:53] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:53] <jasonbraganza> at the very large risk of putting my foot in my mouth, what role do you have when it comes to riot / matrix j4v4m4n? primarily Advocacy?
[13:53] <abhinavshirur> thank you :) <eom>
[13:56] <j4v4m4n> jasonbraganza: I was always looking for a replacement for WhatsApp
[13:57] <j4v4m4n> I used many other Free Software apps, but all them had some feature or other missing
[13:57] <j4v4m4n> finally with matrix and riot, it is mostly feature complete
[13:57] <jasonbraganza> understood. thank you :) <eom>
[13:57] <j4v4m4n> matrix/riot is not the first apps I promote
[13:58] <j4v4m4n> I'm part of the team that runs an matrix server at diasp.in
[13:58] <j4v4m4n> before that we had diaspora and xmpp there and also on poddery.com
[13:59] <j4v4m4n> next
[13:59] <deepika> Why you suggest purple matrix?
[13:59] <deepika> What other projects would you suggest ?
[14:00] <j4v4m4n> deepika: because pidgin is already popular and many people use it and it has excellent accessibility support
[14:00] <j4v4m4n> it runs on many architectures
[14:00] <j4v4m4n> like arm
[14:01] <j4v4m4n> It will work on raspberry pi or other arm boards like Olinuxino Lime2 by Olimex which I use
[14:01] <jasonbraganza> Vamsi_ !
[14:01] <jasonbraganza> sorry!
[14:01] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:01] <j4v4m4n> plus the default riot app is built on nodejs and packaging it for debian is going to take quite some time because most nodejs projects has a lot of dependencies
[14:02] <j4v4m4n> you could choose default riot apps itself and add missign features
[14:02] <j4v4m4n> riot for dekstop and android/ios
[14:03] <j4v4m4n> diaspora, gitlab, debian installer etc some of my favorites projects looking for contributors
[14:03] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:03] <jasonbraganza> If you could, would you tell us how you manage to keep all these balls in the air? Whatâs a day in the life of a freelance software developer like? Do customers in India pay for free software development? Iâm personally vested in this, because thatâs how I see myself in the future.
[14:04] <j4v4m4n> :)
[14:04] <j4v4m4n> even though I say Freelance Free Software consutlant, these days most of my paid work is sponsored by Gitlab
[14:05] <j4v4m4n> I am pretty free to work on it any time, any day
[14:05] <jasonbraganza> thank you :)
[14:05] <j4v4m4n> when I finish 8 hours of work, it could be in a single day or over a week or two, I count it as one day of work completed
[14:06] <jasonbraganza> :)
[14:06] <j4v4m4n> when 7 days are complete, I send them a weekly report
[14:06] <j4v4m4n> and when one month is complete I ask them to pay for next month :)
[14:06] <j4v4m4n> I think last year I completed 4 months of work :)
[14:06] <jasonbraganza> really nice! :)
[14:06] <jasonbraganza> and you are able to spend the rest of your time in outreach then?
[14:07] <j4v4m4n> the rest 8 months of time was spent on community activities, travelling etc
[14:07] <jasonbraganza> you just answered :) Thank you!
[14:08] <j4v4m4n> in between I ran some crowd funding campaigns too
[14:08] <j4v4m4n> for packaging diaspora, grunt, gulp etc
[14:08] <deepika> !
[14:08] <j4v4m4n> I keep conducting packaging sessions whenever I get an ooportunity :)
[14:09] <j4v4m4n> last weekend I was at NIT Calicut and next weekend I will be in Technopark, Trivandrum
[14:09] <j4v4m4n> if any of you want to learn packaging, I'd be happy to help
[14:09] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:09] <deepika> 7:35 PM <j4v4m4n> you could choose default riot apps itself and add missign features
[14:09] <deepika> ^^Have you tried it ð
[14:09] <jasonbraganza> this was super helpful! thank you <eom>
[14:09] <ahole[m]> !
[14:10] <cran-cg> !
[14:10] <j4v4m4n> deepika: did you mean I tried adding features?
[14:10] <deepika> Yeah !
[14:10] <j4v4m4n> I use riot app on desktop and mobile
[14:11] <j4v4m4n> since I'm not a coder, my contributions are mostly for packaging
[14:11] <deepika> Okay ,thanks :)
[14:12] <j4v4m4n> I hope to package riot for debian some day, when I can find time after finishing gitlab and diaspora
[14:12] <singh123> !
[14:13] <j4v4m4n> or even better mentor new people to do packaging and inspire them to package it :)
[14:13] <j4v4m4n> I have asked feature requests
[14:13] <j4v4m4n> and I inspired someone to write a plugin to matrix server (synapse) so we can use the same login as diaspora
[14:14] <j4v4m4n> and he was just in 9th standard!
[14:14] <j4v4m4n> he is in 10th now
[14:14] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:14] <ahole[m]> What do you mean by packaging? Is it something like rpm or deb?
[14:15] <j4v4m4n> https://git.fosscommunity.in/necessary129/synapse-diaspora-auth
[14:15] <j4v4m4n> this code was written by a 9th standard boy - shamil from Kerala in a single day
[14:15] <j4v4m4n> ahole: yes
[14:15] <j4v4m4n> I mentor creating deb packages
[14:16] <j4v4m4n> he also maintains the diaspora service at diasp.in
[14:16] <j4v4m4n> chat.diasp.in
[14:17] <j4v4m4n> currently riot is available from a third party repository maintained by riot developers
[14:17] <j4v4m4n> by packaging, we can add it to official debian repositories
[14:17] <j4v4m4n> so apt-get install riot will work without any extra steps on a default install
[14:18] <j4v4m4n> this means the riot package will get all the testing and quality assurance that every other debian package gets
[14:19] <j4v4m4n> debian is very strict about package quality
[14:19] <j4v4m4n> even though I packaged gitlab and diaspora, only gitlab was accepted in debian stable release because I could not fix the bug in diaspora in time
[14:19] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:19] <cran-cg> My question was asked already but just to confirm, by packaging did you also mean website packaging and bundling tools such as webpack ?<eom>
[14:20] <mriyam> !
[14:20] <ahole[m]> !
[14:22] <j4v4m4n> cran-cg: riot has desktop app, web app, packaging for both, first preference would be for the desktop app
[14:23] <j4v4m4n> webpack also needs to be packaged, yes. But it is already completed.
[14:23] <j4v4m4n> every new software that is packaged for debian needs to be reviewed by debian ftp masters, main to ensure it has a Free software license
[14:24] <j4v4m4n> webpack packaging is complete, but it is waiting for review by ftp masters
[14:24] <j4v4m4n> you can see the list of dependencies for webpack at https://wiki.debian.org/Javascript/Nodejs/Tasks/webpack
[14:25] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:26] <cran-cg> j4v4m4n: Thanks for the information :)
[14:28] <j4v4m4n> you can also ask about Free Software philosophy, privacy, debian etc
[14:30] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:31] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:31] <mriyam> j4v4m4n: The synapse package by Shamil was created as a pip package. Can you point to the repoitory you created for the package you created for gitlab?
[14:31] <mriyam> Is that a pip package or a .deb package? <eom>
[14:31] <ahole[m]> Is there any distro which has riot in its official repository?
[14:32] <ahole[m]> Ops! sorry for asking out of turn.
[14:33] <j4v4m4n> mriyam: yes, the synapse auth plugin is a pip package currently, once synapse itself is packaged as deb (someone is working on it), we will convert this to a deb package
[14:34] <j4v4m4n> https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-ruby-extras/gitlab.git/ has the debian packaging files
[14:34] <sayan> !
[14:38] <j4v4m4n> all debian packaging code/files are inside debian directory
[14:39] <j4v4m4n> for rpm, it is compareable to spec file
[14:39] <j4v4m4n> the gitlab package installs all dependencies, both ruby backend and js front end libries, configures database, web server etc
[14:39] <j4v4m4n> when you run apt-get install it asks you a few questions like enter the domain name and after the install is complete, you can visit the domain and you will see gitlab running, even with https if you choose letsencrypt
[14:41] <j4v4m4n> ahole: I think arch has it in its community repo
[14:41] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:41] <ahole[m]> already answered.
[14:41] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:41] <jasonbraganza> does the Apple App Store allow GPLâed apps on there? or does the license need to change? curious because the riot app is in there
[14:42] <sayan> ahole[m]: j4v4m4n: I know Riot is there in Copr
[14:43] <j4v4m4n> I think Apple store terms are a violation of GPL
[14:43] <sayan> but don't know how updated it is/ or regularly it is updated
[14:43] <j4v4m4n> Riot is apache licensed
[14:43] <jasonbraganza> j4v4m4n - aah should read up on that one then. Thank you :) <eom>
[14:43] <ahole[m]> !
[14:44] <avik> ahole[m], sayan, I just got riot through Corp!
[14:44] <j4v4m4n> you could add a apple store exception to your gpl
[14:45] <ahole[m]> copr or corp ?
[14:45] <ahole[m]> avik: sayan ^^^^
[14:45] <avik> ahole[m], copr sorry!

[14:50] <j4v4m4n> next
[14:50] <sayan> in the book, the cathedral and the bazaar it says that people work on innovative ideas, work on problem they face themselves
[14:51] <sayan> and now in this world of open source people keep building their own projects, technically there is huge number of libraries
[14:52] <sayan> 4-5 implementations of the same idea, with few +/- ideas
[14:52] <j4v4m4n> sayan: the large number usually shows the unwillingness to collaborate
[14:52] <j4v4m4n> and a wrong underestanding of Free Software or Open Source as just dumping your code
[14:53] <j4v4m4n> its worse in javascript
[14:53] <j4v4m4n> they have many modules which has just 2-3 lines
[14:53] <sayan> I know, I do rpm packaging for js packages
[14:53] <sayan> I sit and cry, and say why do you even wrote this package with one file
[14:54] <sayan> which is just a function
[14:54] <sayan> j4v4m4n: but my question is
[14:54] <j4v4m4n> and even rewrting entire apps, like how close is grunt and gulp or browserify and webpack
[14:55] <sayan> when I choose a library, I just check if the code is updated regularly or not and how many people use it
[14:55] <sayan> how much it is beneficial to me
[14:56] <sayan> between updates I don't generally see the code, what maintainer is adding to the library
[14:56] <j4v4m4n> python is much much better in this, buut you can't get rid of javascript for web apps
[14:56] <sayan> I read an article today: https://theoutline.com/post/1953/how-a-vc-funded-company-is-undermining-the-open-source-community
[14:57] <jasonbraganza> i think i lost you guys. what was the question?
[14:57] <sayan> where the maintainer is adding advert of his/her company
[14:58] <sayan> change the core of the package to use the company's engine is which the person got hired
[14:59] <sayan> so how can I stay away from these things? (given that these are pretty much used libraries)
[15:00] <sayan> <eom>
[15:00] <sayan> tldr; how to be updated with the malicious code the maintainer adds to the project?
[15:00] <j4v4m4n> sayan: I think you just have to watch out for such things, I don't see any short cuts
[15:01] <j4v4m4n> we have to be vigilant
[15:01] <j4v4m4n> that is where projects like debian, fedora comes into picture
[15:02] <j4v4m4n> not just this, many developers would want to do similar things
[15:02] <j4v4m4n> distributions acts as a buffer between developers and users
[15:03] <j4v4m4n> for example, systemd wanted to kill all processes of a user when logging out by default, but this behaviour was turned off in debian, fedore etc
[15:03] <j4v4m4n> many developers want latest features but not much interested in long term support
[15:03] <j4v4m4n> so distribtions play that role of giving long term support
[15:04] <j4v4m4n> so try to use packaged apps as much and help packaging new apps
[15:04] <j4v4m4n> next
[15:04] <ahole[m]> Already cleared. :)
[15:06] <sayan> j4v4m4n: but while packaging, I believe packagers rarely see what they code got updated, they just bump the version, build and push
[15:07] <j4v4m4n> sayan: yes, but someone will notice and report bugs
[15:07] <j4v4m4n> that is why we have devel branches and stable branches
[15:08] <j4v4m4n> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=868298
[15:08] <j4v4m4n> we do get lots of bugs when we add new packages to debian like above
[15:09] <j4v4m4n> I invite you all to join #fsci:diasp.in I think it is #fsci in irc.oftc.net
[15:10] <j4v4m4n> you can see a list of user groups across India at fsci.org.in
[15:10] <j4v4m4n> it is not complete, I hope you all will add any missing names there
[15:11] <j4v4m4n> if there is no more questions, we can wind up todays session. Feel free to contact me here or on email praveen at debian.org if you want to contribute to debian or another Free Software project
[15:11] <sayan> sure
[15:12] <j4v4m4n> poddery.com/u/praveen is my diaspora page

[13:31] <imack> Mahendra Yadav
[13:31] <kushal> If anyone here is new to programming in general? Say me.
[13:31] <jasonbraganza> me
[13:31] <mdbk> me
[13:31] <skat-sd> me
[13:32] <poojaencoded> me
[13:32] <yurii> me
[13:32] <kushal> Okay
[13:33] <kushal> We will start looking into programming language Python, and later we will see how can use that to solve issues in our life.
[13:33] <kushal> But, we will go slow.
[13:33] <kushal> And as usual, remember to ask questions.
[13:34] <kushal> If you don't ask questions, we will not be able to answer you.
[13:34] <jasonbraganza> understood
[13:34] <kvy> me
[13:34] <kushal> I am going to skip many technical terms, which you will learn slowly.

[13:35] <kushal> Python has two major revisions of the language, Python2 and Python3
[13:36] <ashwanig> Roll call: Ashwani Kumar Gupta
[13:36] <kushal> For our training, we will use Python3
[13:36] <kushal> Python is an interpreted language, the codebase which implements the python interpreter (which you all have in your computer) is known as CPython.
[13:37] <kushal> There are other Python implementations, like Pypy, Jython.
[13:38] <kushal> 2020 is the when the upstream CPython developers will stop supporting Python2 version, means everyone should start porting their Python2 applications to Python3, or they should start any new project in Python3 only.
[13:38] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language
[13:38] <kushal> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language
[13:38] <kushal> Two links to read
[13:39] <kushal> For later :)
[13:39] <gauravsitlani> !
[13:39] <kushal> next
[13:39] <gauravsitlani> Why two versions of python ?
[13:40] <gauravsitlani> What is the reason behind that i mean to ask?
[13:40] <kushal> gauravsitlani, exactly same reason you can see cars made in 2001, 2015 or even in 2017.
[13:40] <kushal> gauravsitlani, A company makes a car, release it to the market, and then after a few years releases a new version.
[13:41] <kushal> gauravsitlani, Now, for Python3, it has many changes which will break Python2 code, that is why it started a fresh.
[13:41] <CHOCOS> !
[13:41] <kushal> gauravsitlani, If you search, you will find many articles and videos on the subject.
[13:41] <kushal> next
[13:41] <CHOCOS> what do you mean by  interpreted language ?
[13:42] <balaji> !
[13:42] <kushal> CHOCOS, I pasted links, read them later to figure that out.
[13:42] <kushal> next
[13:42] <CHOCOS> +1
[13:42] <balaji> What happen to the larger code bases they have in python 2?
[13:43] <soumam007_> !
[13:43] <balaji> Is they have to start from Scratch or it can be reused?
[13:44] <kushal> balaji, they will have to port the code.
[13:44] <kushal> balaji, they can still use the old code, but there will be no more security updates etc.
[13:44] <kushal> next
[13:44] <soumam007_> now they have started changing the syntax upto a few extent. But was it necesarry to make changes in the basics. I mean adding new features is fine but changing the basics will confuse others right?
[13:45] <kushal> soumam007_, The basics did not change much :)
[13:45] <kushal> soumam007_, also people sometimes accept changes, sometimes they don't.
[13:45] <kushal> Now, everyone open terminal
[13:45] <kushal> type python3
[13:45] <soumam007_> :) ok
[13:45] <kushal> press enter
[13:46] <anuGupta> Roll call: Anu kumari Gupta
[13:46] <championshuttler> !
[13:46] <kushal> You should be in a prompt >>>
[13:46] <jasonbraganza> yes
[13:46] <kushal> That is the python interpreter prompt,
[13:46] <kushal> type
[13:46] <kushal> print("Hello World")
[13:46] <kushal> press enter
[13:47] <kushal> print is a function which is printing the text (we call them string) which is defined by double quotes.
[13:47] <kushal> I mean inside of double quotes.
[13:48] <kushal> Now, change the text to your name, it should show your name.
[13:48] <jasonbraganza> yes!
[13:48] <pr97> yes:)
[13:48] <kvy_> yes
[13:49] <mdbk> :)
[13:50] <kushal> Now, one super big thing, spaces.
[13:50] <kushal> Press up arrow, and give a space before print, and then press enter.
[13:50] <kushal> Someone paste the error here.
[13:51] <jasonbraganza> IndentationError
[13:51] <kushal> Correct
[13:51] <kushal> Remember this Error name.
[13:51] <kushal> This will be the most common error for most of you.
[13:52] <schubisu> !
[13:52] <kushal> Python will force you to learn to type cleaner code
[13:52] <kushal> To know about indentation in general, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style
[13:52] <kushal> next
[13:52] <championshuttler> why it is mandatory to use parenthesis in python3
[13:53] <ashwanig> championshuttler, Because of the syntax?
[13:53] <kushal> where?
[13:53] <championshuttler> earlier in python2.7 it was not <eom>
[13:53] <kushal> championshuttler, You asked half of the question
[13:53] <championshuttler> kushal: for print command
[13:55] <kushal> championshuttle4, Few things.
[13:55] <kvy_> championshuttler  I think it is a syntax as we use in C.
[13:55] <kushal> championshuttler, Python is a programming language, print was never a command, but a syntax.
[13:55] <kushal> I mean statement.
[13:55] <kushal> Now print is a function.
[13:55] <kushal> championshuttler, Even in your python2, try print("Hello World")
[13:56] <kushal> next
[13:56] <schubisu> kushal: I cannot use arrow keys up and down to browse the previous lines in normal python3 shell, neither ctrl+p. Is there another way other than use IPython?
[13:56] <championshuttler> kushal : ok :)
[13:56] <kushal> schubisu, Eh, I thought that is default, maybe I am wrong.
[13:56] <kushal> schubisu, I will pass a solution after the session.
[13:56] <jasonbraganza> kushal - it worked in my Fedora
[13:57] <schubisu> kushal: yes, I'm running anaconda python3, okay, thanks
[13:57] <kushal> schubisu, Oh
[13:57] <vivek_> it is working in mine, normal py3
[13:57] <kushal> We will use http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ this book for our starting purpose.
[13:58] <kushal> brb
[13:59] <ahole[m]> Try this on your interpreter: (This is just for newbies)
[13:59] <kushal> We can start writing code in the interpreter, but in a few hours, you will find that it is easier to write the code in .py file, and then execute that.
[13:59] <poojaencoded> !
[14:00] <kushal> Here using a proper editor helps.
[14:00] <ashwanig> ahole[m], try what?
[14:00] <ahole[m]> Okay. kushal is back avoid the previous message.
[14:00] <kushal> Vim/Emacs are super good.
[14:00] <kushal> But, I know many people like IDE(s).
[14:00] <kushal> I would suggest either of two options.
[14:01] <kushal> You can download and use https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ community edition
[14:01] <pr97_> sorry kushal, but which two options?
[14:01] <pr97_> i got disconnected:(
[14:01] <ashwanig> pr97_, Text editors or IDE
[14:01] <kushal> or https://code.visualstudio.com/
[14:01] <pr97_> okay thanks ashwanig :)
[14:02] <RIcharD_> kushal, can't we simply use our terminal?
[14:02] <kushal> If you are low on RAM, https://code.visualstudio.com/ is easier.
[14:03] <kushal> RIcharD_, You can, if you want :)
[14:03] <kushal> No need to download these right now.
[14:03] <kushal> There is one more solution, which can help us to learn easily.
[14:04] <kushal> https://notebooks.azure.com/   but this will require a login to the microsoftonline, if you don't have one, you can make one.
[14:04] <ahole[m]> RIcharD_:  Terminal is only good for small code snippets.
[14:04] <kushal> The notebooks will on a 4GB ram based containers.
[14:05] <kushal> There are a lot of restrictions, but can be a good option for learning, as it will be easier to show us the erros.
[14:05] <kushal> * errors.
[14:05] <kushal> ahole[m], Not always, we use vim + terminal for all remote developments.
[14:06] <ahole[m]> kushal: Remote developement of python code?
[14:06] <anuGupta> Rlchard_ , actually every line is interpreted at each and every line which we sometimes don't want and the other thing is we use text editors to store our programs
[14:06] <kushal> Now, I will wait for 5 minutes, if you want please go ahead and create an account in https://notebooks.azure.com/ or use your existing login
[14:07] <kushal> Or you can follow along using your local system.
[14:07] <RIcharD_> PyCharm only supports python and web development, whereas visual studio code is an IDE for almost every language
[14:07] <poojaencoded> kushal: I have 2GB ram
[14:07] <kushal> RIcharD_, wrong statement.
[14:07] <kushal> next
[14:07] <kushal> poojaencoded, Download code later.
[14:08] <kushal> RIcharD_, if you install the plugins, you will be do everything in PyCharm itself.
[14:08] <kushal> We are going into other direction than Python, let us come back to today's session.
[14:08] <kushal> When you read with a login, say ready here.
[14:09] <apoorv> ready
[14:09] <jasonbraganza> ready
[14:09] <kushal> I will 3 more minutes
[14:10] <ravindra> ready

[14:11] <jasonbraganza> ahole[m] - let me just follow instructions here for now!
[14:11] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, you are right!
[14:12] <RIcharD_> ready
[14:12] <kushal> I will wait one more minute
[14:12] <soumam007> kushal done login with azure notebooks but dont have an IDE

[14:16] <asraisingh> kushal, dgplug library showing status stopped .
[14:17] <asraisingh> Is it correct?
[14:17] <kushal> asraisingh, Yes, click on it to go inside of it.
[14:18] <asraisingh> ok done
[14:19] <kushal> Everyone should see something like https://kushaldas.in/emptylibrary.png
[14:19] <kushal> tell me if you don't see that
[14:20] <kushal> Click on +New
[14:20] <kushal> Give name of the notebook as "summertraining"
[14:20] <poojaencoded> !
[14:20] <kushal> and select python3.6 as language
[14:22] <kushal> next
[14:22] <poojaencoded> we have to give library description also?
[14:22] <kushal> poojaencoded, nope
[14:22] <kushal> and after creating the notebook, click on it
[14:22] <poojaencoded> okay :)
[14:23] <kushal> https://kushaldas.in/readynotebook.png  you should see a notebook ready like this.

[14:26] <kushal> Next, type print("Hello World") in that box
[14:26] <kushal> and then click on the run cell button
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> wow
[14:27] <kushal> Or press Ctrl+enter
[14:27] <kushal> If you press Ctrl+Enter, then it will execute the code, and keep the pointer to the same cell
[14:28] <kushal> If you press Shift+Enter, then it will execute the code, and open a new cell below.
[14:28] <samridhia> !
[14:28] <kushal> After you have done your print function test, now in the same cell add another call, print your name there, and then paste the link to the notebook (from the URL) here.
[14:28] <kushal> next
[14:28] <samridhia> what is that "In [ ]"?
[14:29] <samridhia> i did run cell 2 times so the number inside those brackets exceeded by 1 !

[14:33] <jasonbraganza> my second link?
[14:33] <kushal> Python is a dynamic language
[14:33] <kushal> try the following
[14:33] <kushal> 2 + 4
[14:33] <kushal> 21 * 2
[14:33] <avik> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/w50Y87mDsHs/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb

[14:34] <kushal> print(2 + 4)
[14:34] <kushal> print(21 * 2)
[14:34] <kushal> like these
[14:34] <kushal> You can now do simple arithmetic
[14:35] <kushal>  / is for division
[14:36] <kushal> You will have to keep practicing there, it will easier for us to see the errors or output.
[14:36] <ikshitij> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/PMlQyZdJoH0/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:36] <kushal> For tonight, start reading from the beginning to operators chapter in http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[14:37] <kushal> If you have questions ask for help here.
[14:37] <kushal> Any queries till now?
[14:37] <samridhia> !
[14:37] <kushal> next
[14:37] <anuGupta> !
[14:37] <kushal> next
[14:38] <anuGupta> Why are we using in notebook?<eof>
[14:38] <kushal> anuGupta, So that it becomes easier for us to help.
[14:38] <samridhia> When i did 2+4 as it is without a print statement it gave out[], what that denotes?
[14:38] <kushal> At least in the starting.
[14:39] <kushal> Later you can use anything you want.
[14:39] <kushal> samridhia, let me check
[14:39] <championshuttler> https://notebooks.azure.com/run/championshuttler/dgplug?dest=/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb

[14:40] <kushal> samridhia, I can not see that
[14:40] <kushal> samridhia, I can see out[9]
[14:40] <samridhia> yes
[14:40] <kushal> and then next empty cell
[14:40] <kushal> next
[14:40] <soumam007> i gave a space before print statement but no errors are shown
[14:40] <skat-sd> https://notebooks.azure.com/skat-sd/libraries/dgplug
[14:40] <samridhia> kushal, so why that out[9] and a answer?
[14:40] <kushal> samridhia, means?
[14:41] <kushal> You typed something and then pressed shift enter
[14:41] <ikshitij> samridhia: link ?
[14:41] <kushal> and it gave you answer and a new cell.
[14:41] <kushal> soumam007, There are few issues, 1. you created a private notebook, 2. you named it wrong, you gave a space between summertraining
[14:41] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:41] <samridhia> kushal, when i am not giving a print statement, so how is it that working and showing correct answer with "out[]"?
[14:42] <kushal> samridhia, It is actually returning the result of 2 + 3
[14:42] <kushal> samikshan, write this
[14:42] <kushal> a = 2 + 3
[14:42] <kushal> samridhia, ^^
[14:42] <kushal> next
[14:43] <jasonbraganza> iâm on the variables and datatypes lesson
[14:43] <samridhia> ok got it kushal
[14:43] <kushal> jasonbraganza, Okay
[14:43] <jasonbraganza> should i just type code blindly to understand what happens?
[14:44] <soumam007> ok kushal i will create a new one but why isnt it showing the indentation error when i am giving a space, it has nothing to do with the name right?
[14:44] <jasonbraganza> itâs kind of pseudo english. i kind of understand it.
[14:44] <kushal> jasonbraganza, you can skip average and temp code
[14:44] <kushal> soumam007, because notebook is smart enough

[13:42] <kushal> samridhia, Nice blog posts :)
[13:42] <samridhia> thanks, kushal
[13:42] <sayan> no more questions?
[13:42] <sayan> This is good :
[13:42] <sayan> :)
[13:43] <skat-sd> !
[13:43] <sayan> next
[13:43] <skat-sd> There  is a line in the book "In Python we donât specify what kind of data we are going to put in a variable.". But then, while reading input from keyboard for a variable, we are using float, int, etc. Please explain this.
[13:44] <skat-sd> <EOM>
[13:44] <kushal> skat-sd, a = 213
[13:45] <kushal> a = 32.4
[13:45] <kushal> a = "I am not saying that I am dog on Internet"
[13:45] <kushal> skat-sd, ^^^ not defining the data type.
[13:46] <championshuttler> !
[13:46] <skat-sd> I thought python will auto-detect data type while scanning user input just like we are not mentioning data type while declaring a variable.
[13:47] <im_mohsin> skat-sd, when you have to explicitly typecast the input to your desired form like this like this int(input()). This is typecasting to make it into integer and do regular integer operation on it
[13:48] <im_mohsin> s/when/then
[13:48] <sayan> next
[13:48] <skat-sd> im_mohsin, okay, so we are only going the required specific way by that. Thanks
[13:49] <asraisingh> !
[13:49] <championshuttler> doubt cleared :)
[13:49] <sayan> next
[13:49] <asraisingh> why python always takes input in string, as it identifies the data type automatically?
[13:50] <sayan> asraisingh: input always returns string
[13:51] <sayan> I am sure there is somewhere in PEP written on why or maybe in doc
[13:51] <asraisingh> ok
[13:51] <sayan> but I have not thought on it why
[13:52] <sayan> Ok, people can you start reading: http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ifelse.html

[14:00] <poojaencoded> done
[14:01] <balaji> done
[14:03] <sayan> once you start programming, you would come to a point when you need your program to decide a detour based on condition
[14:04] <sayan> for example you are operating a mobile store
[14:04] <sayan> and you are told to sell mobiles only to people with the age greater than 18
[14:05] <sayan> so you would put a condition in your program that
[14:05] <sayan> if the age of the person is greater than 18
[14:05] <sayan> then go ahead sell the mobile
[14:05] <sayan> or else you soo off the kid :)
[14:05] <sayan> this is also called control flow
[14:06] <sayan> because at the end of the day you are managing the control of your program
[14:06] <sayan> the syntax is
[14:06] <sayan> if condition:
[14:06] <sayan>     do stuff if the condition is true
[14:06] <sayan> else:
[14:06] <sayan>    do stuff is the condition is false
[14:07] <sayan> note the else part is optional
[14:07] <sayan> that means if the age of the person is greater that 18; then you sell the mobile
[14:08] <sayan> and if you don't put the else condition in there, your program will just ignore and passon
[14:08] <sayan> - Few things to remember
[14:08] <sayan> - each if and else line ends with colon
[14:08] <sayan> followed by idented lines
[14:09] <sayan> can somebody explain what is indentation?
[14:09] <jasonbraganza> pushing stuff ahead of the margin, by spaces or tabs
[14:09] <hemanth_> we use tab spacing to make code more readable.
[14:09] <jiteshpabla> The space we leave on the left side of the page in text and code
[14:10] <skat-sd> empty space at the beginning of a line to start something new in it
[14:10] <anuGupta> It is very important in python. To declare the scope of a set of statements in a loop or conditional check we use indentation
[14:11] <anuGupta> Suppose we need to put a set of statements under any type of loop or conditional check, we give spaces and maintain the equal amount of spaces throughout within that
[14:12] <Guest92539> the prorper allignment of code is called indentation.
[14:12] <san-D> it shows that the indented lines belong to the above unindented statement
[14:13] <championshuttler> A space left between the left-hand margin of a line of type or handwriting and the beginning of a sentence or quotation
[14:13] <avik> Indentation in python is basically discriminating a block of code, by maintaining a certain space from the margin.
[14:14] <sayan> right, idendation in python is more than just shifting the code
[14:14] <sayan> it is a way to define the scope of the code
[14:16] <sayan> >>> if x < 0:
[14:16] <sayan> ...      x = 0
[14:16] <tenida> sayan: Error: ".." is not a valid command.
[14:16] <sayan> ...      print('Negative changed to zero')
[14:16] <tenida> sayan: Error: ".." is not a valid command.
[14:17] <sayan> so if you see here, the idented code is the then block
[14:17] <sayan> there are only 2 lines in the then block
[14:17] <sayan> and if the condition is tru
[14:17] <sayan> s/tru/true/
[14:17] <sayan> those 2 lines would be executed
[14:17] <sayan> any questions?
[14:18] <sayan> seems like no
[14:19] <skat-sd> !
[14:19] <sayan> next
[14:19] <skat-sd> What was the truth value testing at the bottom of the page?
[14:20] <championshuttler> !
[14:21] <sayan> skat-sd: i was planning to come to it later
[14:21] <skat-sd> sayan, okay.
[14:24] <sayan> in Python even if you don't give a condition
[14:24] <sayan> like x==0, or x<=10
[14:24] <sayan> at the end of the day python checks if the condition is true or false
[14:25] <sayan> there for even if you give just if True
[14:25] <sayan> or if False, that would just work
[14:26] <sayan> so write a program to take input from user two numbers, number_1 & number_2
[14:26] <sayan> and preferred operation ( +, -, /, *)
[14:26] <sayan> after the inputs print the result
[14:27] <sayan> Do this task on the azure notebook

[15:01] <sayan> avik: can you paste your link here?
[15:01] <sayan> next
[15:01] <championshuttler> what is pass in python?
[15:01] <avik> sayan, https://notebooks.azure.com/technotron/libraries/dgplug/html/calculator_ifelse.ipynb
[15:02] <sayan> okay people look in avik solution and tell what can be improved?
[15:02] <kushal> No one read the question statement sayan told.
[15:03] <Guest92539> instead of taking a variable named result he could have directly printed the result
[15:03] <sayan> championshuttler: pass is just a placeholder, does nothing
[15:03] <RIcharD_> And the code can be shorter. Saving time :)
[15:04] <jasonbraganza> his variables have to be in curly braces?
[15:04] <sayan> RIcharD_: shorter code != saving time
[15:04] <jasonbraganza> in the print statements?
[15:04] <RIcharD_> sayan, okay.
[15:04] <sayan> he repeated the line print
[15:05] <sayan> which is not ideal
[15:05] <avik> Guest92539, yes, i could have done that! I was initially planning to print the result once , after all if/else conditions!, then realised a problem in that!
[15:05] <sayan> avik: what?
[15:05] <asraisingh> input command produces string and avik directly processed the string not typecasting into int or float which is more preffered.
[15:05] <avik> sayan, the else at the end might cause a problem
[15:06] <jasonbraganza> asraisingh - he made floarts
[15:06] <sayan> avik: there is a way to fix that
[15:06] <sayan> avik: if condition on result
[15:07] <avik> like if I gave say 4 as an operator, it would first print the error! then woulgd go on to print an result, which had not been calculated! thus giving a garbage value!
[15:07] <avik> sayan, yes!
[15:07] <avik> I thought of that!
[15:07] <avik> *I did not thought of that
[15:07] <asraisingh> jasonbraganza, sorry
[15:07] <sayan> :)
[15:07] <sayan> next
[15:07] <vharsh> sayan, I couldn't login into my Windows Live account. So I posted a gist.
[15:08] <avik> sayan, thanks :D
[15:08] <sayan> vharsh: ok
[15:08] <sayan> Going ahead, I am not continuing with loops which I thought
[15:09] <sayan> because people cannot read
[15:09] <sayan> So, I would like to talk on that
[15:09] <sayan> I specifically told to write number_1, number_2 and operator
[15:09] <sayan> people did not read that :(
[15:09] <sayan> So, here are few things I would like to tell on naming variables
[15:11] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, give something else as operator and then check the answer
[15:11] <jasonbraganza> bhavin192 - i know. will fix later. listening right now
[15:11] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, oops sorry, it is a black else
[15:12] <sayan> so, there are two ways of naming followed in Python
[15:12] <sayan> - this_is_a_variable_name
[15:12] <sayan> see how the variable name is self explainable
[15:13] <sayan> and it is seperated by underscore
[15:13] <sayan> all the letters are small
[15:13] <sayan> most of the Python folks follow this convention
[15:13] <sayan> but few places you would see this
[15:13] <sayan> - thisIsAVariable
[15:14] <sayan> This is called camelCase, not much followed (only in the test cases I have seen)
[15:14] <sayan> seen in testcases because of the practices come from Java
[15:14] <sayan> ^^ afaik
[15:14] <sayan> so, DONT use variables name like a, b, c, d, i, j
[15:15] <sayan> I really don't know what they mean
[15:15] <avik> !
[15:15] <sayan> nor the project maintainers, the maintainers have huge load of work so having these variable names just annoys them
[15:16] <sayan> variables name should be self-explanatory
[15:16] <sayan> like number_1 instead of n1, num1, num2, or even number1
[15:16] <sayan> this last one because it's not seperated by underscore
[15:17] <sayan> you can also write number_one
[15:17] <sayan> Always, remember while writing code, the person who would be reading and maintaining your code 10 years later has your home address
[15:18] <sayan> You really don't want to annoy that person
[15:18] <sayan> next
[15:18] <avik> isn't 'i' used for iterations?
[15:18] <sayan> avik: nope
[15:18] <avik> so what should we use?
[15:19] <sayan> for school in schools?
[15:19] <avik> "x" in range?
[15:19] <avik> ok!
[15:19] <avik> got that! thanks. <eom>
[15:20] <sayan> Like in IRC, some of the shortforms are allowed like brb, bbiab
[15:20] <sayan> similarly there are few variable names that you can use
[15:20] <sayan> like I use elem a lot, but I am moving to using element
[15:21] <sayan> for elem in range(): for element in range()
[15:21] <ashwanig> !
[15:21] <sayan> next
[15:21] <ashwanig> Why do we use capital letters for a constant? <eof>
[15:22] <sayan> I really don't know the reason, but it is defined in PEP8
[15:22] <ashwanig> okay
[15:22] <sayan> Next, thing is read, even though this is a small question, you read the specifications wrong
[15:23] <sayan> suppose a airline company had been using your code, surely 2-3 planes would have come down
[15:23] <sayan> specifications are important because other people depend on them
[15:24] <sayan> Another thing is people/project have style guides, you need to read before contributing or working to their project
[15:24] <sayan> if you are working on someone else project, you follow their code style guide
[15:24] <sayan> any questions?
[15:25] <jasonbraganza> no. this was clear
[15:25] <sayan> I would recommend people to read PEP 8 every 6 months
[15:25] <sayan> https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
[15:26] <kushal> sayan, it is also in the book :)
[15:26] <sayan> kushal: hope people read that
[15:26] <sayan> also read this blog: http://treyhunner.com/2017/07/craft-your-python-like-poetry/

[13:46] <bhavin192> done nothing using Python this weekend :(
[13:46] <sayan> Next moving to blogging
[13:46] <sayan> How many people are reguarly blogging?
[13:46] <ikshitij> sayan me
[13:46] <samridhia> me
[13:46] <ikshitij> :)
[13:46] <NikitaK3> me
[13:47] <soumam> :( could not but i will
[13:47] <asraisingh> sayan, not a regular but do little bit blogging
[13:47] <championshuttler> me i wrote a blog once in a week
[13:47] <sayan> This is sad
[13:48] <sayan> I am really sad with the people actually writing code, practicing stuffs
[13:48] <balaji> I wrote one blog this weekend
[13:48] <ravindra> i will write a blog tonight
[13:48] <kvy_> Not reguarly but one post's in a week.
[13:48] <sayan> I follow the students planet regularly and I see a few of the people regularly blogging
[13:49] <sayan> Okay I am starting with looping
[13:50] <sayan> Sometimes you need to execute a part of code multiple times
[13:50] <sayan> so what you do is you loop through the code
[13:50] <sayan> There are primarily three types
[13:50] <sayan> - for loop
[13:50] <sayan> - while loop
[13:52] <sayan> so first I will be covering while loop
[13:52] <sayan> the syntax of while loop is
[13:52] <sayan> while (condition):
[13:52] <sayan>     lines to execute
[13:53] <sayan> so this loops keeps on running till the condition is true
[13:53] <sayan> so if need to print the first 10 numbers
[13:54] <sayan> counter = 0
[13:54] <sayan> while counter < 10:
[13:54] <sayan>     print(counter)
[13:54] <sayan>     counter = counter + 1
[13:54] <sayan>  
[13:54] <sayan> so this is the code to print the first 10 numbers from 1-10
[13:54] <sayan> sorry 0-9
[13:55] <sayan> so, first we intialize the value of the counter to 0
[13:55] <sayan> then if enters the while loop checks the condition
[13:55] <sayan> counter < 10 which is 0 < 10 which is True
[13:55] <sayan> so the code enters within the while loop
[13:55] <sayan> prints coutner
[13:56] <sayan> next increments the value of counter by 1
[13:57] <sayan> now the value of the counter is 2
[13:57] <sayan> so it then checks the value and if true enters the loop
[13:57] <sayan> and if false exits the loop
[13:57] <sayan> any question?
[13:58] <sayan> Okay so no question so moving ahead
[13:58] <championshuttler> !
[13:58] <santoshShaw> Roll Call: santosh kumar shaw
[13:59] <soumam> !
[13:59] <sayan> next
[13:59] <championshuttler> so while always run the code again
[13:59] <sayan> if the condition is true
[13:59] <sayan> yes
[14:00] <sayan> next
[14:00] <soumam> we say python takes less code , but counter++ is not supported .Its fetching error :(
[14:00] <championshuttler> !
[14:00] <sayan> soumam: what do you mean by python takes less code
[14:01] <ikshitij> soumam: use counter+=1
[14:01] <soumam> in python they say it takes less line to code the same thing but ++ isnt supported
[14:01] <soumam> ikshitij, ok
[14:02] <sayan> soumam: yes, it's not there
[14:02] <sayan> ikshitij: soumam you should use counter = counter + 1
[14:02] <soumam> ok
[14:02] <sayan> counter += 1 and counter = counter + 1 is not always equal
[14:02] <sayan> next
[14:03] <championshuttler> doubt cleared :)
[14:03] <pr97> !
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:03] <ikshitij> ok
[14:03] <apoorv> !
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:03] <kvy_> !
[14:03] <apoorv> can you explain how  counter += 1 and counter = counter + 1 is not always equal
[14:03] <ikshitij> !
[14:03] <pr97> sayan what is the difference between  counter += 1 and  counter = counter + 1 ?
[14:04] <NikitaK3> !
[14:04] <sayan> apoorv: pr97: nope, beyond the scope of class
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <ikshitij> sayan: any example or case where i = i+1 and i+=1 is different
[14:04] <kvy_> How to stop a stop a program in notebook i enter wrong condition <eof>
[14:05] <pr97> sayan: okay
[14:05] <sayan> ikshitij: nope, not now
[14:05] <sayan> kvy_: I need to check that myself
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <NikitaK3> had the same question as apoorv, pr97.
[14:06] <avik> kvy_, use the square button
[14:06] <kvy_> avik i will try it
[14:06] <soumam007_> !
[14:06] <avik> ok! :)
[14:06] <jasonbraganza> SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING! but Iâm new and Iâm trying to learn the basics here. Request all you more experienced folks to ask comparative and performance questions after class! i donât care what program is faster. Right now I need ro learn to *write* the darned thing and the questions are slowing the flow
[14:07] <kushal> slow clap to jasonbraganza
[14:07] <ikshitij> jasonbraganza: right !
[14:08] <soumam007_> ok sayan move ahead :)
[14:08] <sayan> brb
[14:09] <soumam007_> hello jasonbraganza , so you are liking this? :)
[14:10] <sayan> back
[14:10] <sayan> next
[14:10] <soumam007_> move ahead:)
[14:10] <sayan> jasonbraganza: well, I did take a long lecture one this but people just don't care to listen
[14:11] <sayan> s/one/on
[14:11] <sayan> Okay, I am glad to see that I did a typo, a major one
[14:11] <sayan> but nobody noticed, or rectified it
[14:11] <sayan> or raise hand to ask why
[14:12] <jasonbraganza> iâll just turn ornery like this next time !
[14:12] <sayan> This totally tells how much the class reads the log that I type
[14:13] <sayan> I won't be correcting it, it's on you to figure out
[14:13] <sayan> Moving ahead
[14:13] <avik> sayan, the do-while loop?
[14:14] <avik> sayan, you said three types but mentioned two
[14:14] <jasonbraganza> sayan - i thought that was a surprise for later
[14:14] <sayan> sometimes you cannot determine the what would be the condition
[14:14] <championshuttler> sayan: said 3 types of loops but mentioned 2
[14:15] <kvy_> sayan I think python do not support do-while.
[14:15] <sayan> or you probably cannot pass it via the while loop
[14:15] <sayan> that's when you start the infinite loop
[14:16] <sayan> and within the loop you mention the condition and check for the condition
[14:16] <sayan> if the condition is true you tell the code to break out of the loop
[14:17] <sayan> to break out of the loop, you use `break`
[14:17] <sayan> while True:
[14:17] <sayan>     if condition:
[14:17] <sayan>         break
[14:17] <sayan> so this is the structure of the code then
[14:17] <sayan> any questions till here?
[14:18] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:18] <sayan> avik: there is no do-while loop in Python
[14:18] <sayan> so that had to be 2 types
[14:18] <avik> sayan, ok!
[14:18] <avik> sorry!
[14:18] <sayan> there also a known typo I did
[14:19] <sayan> next
[14:19] <jasonbraganza> what scenario would I use an infinite loop in? <eom>
[14:19] <avik> jasonbraganza, say you want that calculator to run for an infinite time.
[14:20] <avik> user wants to calculate one after another
[14:20] <soumam007_> condition 2<5
[14:20] <soumam007_> jasonbraganza:
[14:20] <jasonbraganza> understood. when you need persistence of some sort. thank you <eom>
[14:20] <soumam007_> ok i misunderstood
[14:20] <avik> :D
[14:21] <sayan> jasonbraganza: https://github.com/sayanchowdhury/fedimg/blob/feature/modular-ec2/fedimg/services/ec2/ec2imgpublisher.py#L74
[14:21] <sayan> check this code
[14:21] <jasonbraganza> sayan - will do. thank you <eom>
[14:21] <sayan> here I retrying the code, but I don't have the condition to exit out of the loop
[14:21] <sayan> s/I/I am/
[14:22] <sayan> so I put the condition inside
[14:22] <jasonbraganza> youâre waiting until the copy is complete?
[14:22] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yes
[14:22] <jasonbraganza> now I undertand why variables have to be cleanly named. Thank you <eom>
[14:23] <sayan> next
[14:23] <mbtamuli12> jasonbraganza: Similar condition here - https://github.com/fitztrev/weechat-zmq-notifier/blob/master/client/irc-notifier#L49

[14:46] <ashwanig> sakshi, Same problem
[14:46] <apoorv_> Never mind
[14:47] <balaji> ashwanig, In library information it shows public
[14:47] <ikshitij> balaji: Nope ! It's still private
[14:47] <sayan> bhavin192, ikshitij, abhinavshirur, ravindra, akshayg96, avik did solve the problem
[14:47] <balaji> public library check box is ticked
[14:47] <sayan> avik: why did you use the extra number variable?
[14:48] <avik> otherwise i had to increment start
[14:48] <avik> which I thought was not a goot idea
[14:48] <ravindra> yes pasted the fpaste link as i am using my local python
[14:49] <avik> s/goot/good
[14:49] <sayan> avik: okay
[14:49] <ikshitij> avik: we had no use of start again in program !
[14:49] <sayan> avik: but we did not use it again you could have used it
[14:49] <avik> ikshitij, thats true! my bad :(
[14:49] <sayan> avik: it's okay
[14:49] <avik> sayan, ok.
[14:50] <sayan> any questions?
[14:50] <kvy_> can't i able to give link in last class.Is there any problem ? <eof>
[14:51] <sayan> kvy_: did not get you, can you elaborate
[14:51] <kvy_> and is my program code wrong ?
[14:51] <kvy_> <eof>
[14:51] <ashwanig> !
[14:52] <kvy_> I do not take last session so
[14:52] <sayan> kvy_: I don't see the link in there

[14:55] <sayan> next
[14:55] <ashwanig> Is there any difference between while(i < 10) and while i < 10 ? <eom>
[14:55] <sakshi> i dont know what is the problem in my link that i pasted
[14:55] <xyz_> sayan i haven't used the azure nootebook but given another link, please check if the code is okay!
[14:55] <sakshi> when i am opening the link in my laptop it is opening
[14:55] <championshuttler> sakshi: follow the format bhavin192 just shared :)
[14:56] <sakshi> but ashwanig said its not opening
[14:56] <sakshi> ok champioshuttler
[14:56] <ikshitij> sakshi: Can't see your code
[14:56] <sayan> ashwanig: no
[14:56] <sayan> ashwanig: until you have multiple conditions
[14:57] <ashwanig> sayan, for that we can use && or `and`
[14:57] <ashwanig> right?
[14:57] <sayan> ashwanig: yes
[14:57] <sayan> xyz_: looks good
[14:57] <sayan> moving ahead
[14:58] <ashwanig> sakshi, Your link is not in that format. Check that.
[14:58] <ashwanig> sayan, Thanks
[14:58] <sayan> I did not see those people whose links where not correct
[14:58] <sakshi> ok ashwanig
[14:58] <ikshitij> ashwanig: && is not supported in python !
[14:58] <sayan> so at the end bhavin192, ikshitij, abhinavshirur, ravindra, akshayg96, avik, xyz_ are the ones who did it correctly
[14:59] <sayan> ashwanig: yeah && is not supported in python
[14:59] <anuGupta> Is it not visible yet?
[14:59] <ashwanig> Oops sorry. :(
[15:00] <pr97_> !
[15:00] <sayan> next
[15:00] <pr97_> sayan, why we are using infinite while loop?
[15:00] <ikshitij> ashwanig: I use 'and' in C also. I just define '&&' as 'and' on top of program :)
[15:01] <sayan> pr97_: I just gave this for the question and practice
[15:01] <sayan> this can be done using the finite loop also
[15:01] <pr97_> yes
[15:01] <pr97_> but why are we using infinite loop then?
[15:01] <sayan> For next class I want people to build something innovative using whatever you learnt till date
[15:01] <sayan> pr97_: practice
[15:01] <ashwanig> ikshitij, I wonder why you do that :D
[15:02] <pr97_> okay sayan
[15:02] <sayan> so, that includes git also
[15:02] <sayan> and github also
[15:03] <jasonbraganza> sayan - as in hosting what we write in a repo online?
[15:03] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yes
[15:03] <jasonbraganza> got it. thank you <eom>
[15:03] <sayan> Basically whatever you have learnt till that
[15:04] <ashwanig> jasonbraganza, hosting?
[15:04] <sayan> That includes a bunch of things so I want to see how much of things you actually remember
[15:04] <sayan> Roll Call

[15:07] <avik> Avik Mukherjee
[15:07] <ikshitij> ashwanig: a comman syntax for both, after writing code in python for few days. I switched to C for few problems and there I started typing print instead of printf, and instead of && ! So I defined a few on top just to avoid errors :)

[13:58] <akshayg96> kushal, okay I will
[13:58] <kushal> akshayg96, also you never mentioned any license
[13:58] <sayan> People can you please answer? I cannot really sit idle here staring at the screen
[13:58] <avik> I am still working on in! :(
[13:59] <akshayg96> kushal, I forgot that :(
[13:59] <sayan> avik: you can put the github link atleast?
[13:59] <samridhia> i did no new work on GitHub in last two days :-(
[13:59] <avik> I am writing on the notebook
[13:59] <_RicharD_> I did nothing. And got to work on this today. :/
[14:00] <kushal> And others?
[14:00] <sayan> avik: writing in a notebook?
[14:00] <balaji> Shall I update it tomorrow ?
[14:00] <sayan> balaji: why not today?
[14:01] <avik> https://notebooks.azure.com/technotron/libraries/dgplug/html/number_converter.ipynb
[14:01] <cignatious> i came back after almost 3 weeks and i am still catching up, sorry
[14:01] <balaji> sayan,  I am not done yet
[14:02] <ashwanig> Sorry, can I do it after the class? I have not started it.
[14:02] <kushal> avik, that notebook is from 30minutes of work.
[14:02] <anuGupta> I missed your question sayan
[14:02] <NikitaK3> I missed last few sessions, catching up with the logs.
[14:03] <avik> yeah, that took me 1 hour yesterday
[14:03] <sayan> NikitaK3: if I remember correctly, you attended last class
[14:03] <avik> and then a few more hours to get the logics
[14:03] <ikshitij> sayan: I had classes and lab work ! I will update next day for sure.
[14:03] <avik> of conversion
[14:03] <santoshShaw> Roll Call: Santosh Kumar Shaw
[14:04] <avik> kushal, Its all done, I will finish it by today!
[14:04] <sayan> Seriously speaking, we all have jobs, classes, lab work or any other work you have
[14:05] <NikitaK3> sayan, yes but I was unable to attend the entire last session. And also missed few sessions before the last one. I will surely finish all the logs till tomorrow.
[14:05] <sayan> samridhia: I know your work because I am reading your blog regularly
[14:06] <samridhia> sayan, ok
[14:06] <sayan> samridhia: but you have to push your code
[14:07] <mdbk> I'm new to python language, still getting around with the basics for more understanding
[14:07] <sayan> mdbk: that means you need to come here and ask more questions
[14:08] <kushal> Point is very simple: If you don't work, we will not care.
[14:08] <samridhia> sayan, I am not yet so well versed with GitHub, so investing my most of the time experimenting GitHub for now.
[14:08] <kushal> If we our lives, and we will be busy helping out people who really need help.
[14:08] <mdbk> sayan: okay
[14:08] <Guest11596> i missed some git sessions. was reading them yesterday.
[14:09] <kushal> You will keep looking at them because they will become better, they will work better projects, and work on good jobs (in future, eventually) etc etc.
[14:09] <sayan> Guest11596: I already told you to change your nick once
[14:09] <bhavin192> Guest11596, may we know, who are you? :(
[14:09] <kushal> No one is paying us to help you.
[14:09] <Guest11596> atul kumar
[14:09] <championshuttler> Shivam Singhal
[14:09] <kushal> bhavin192, No we can not (at least that is what he thinks).
[14:10] <kushal> championshuttler, What exactly are you smoking during the class?
[14:10] <kushal> Please do it afterwards.
[14:10] <kushal> You all are online, but doing nothing.
[14:10] <kushal> Only 3 people submitted links to their github repos.
[14:11] <kushal> It is okay if you are slow, and doing something taught in the old sessions, but there must be a blog post showing that.
[14:11] <sayan> jasonbraganza came online to ask how was his code written
[14:11] <ikshitij> kushal sayan I am doing now, writing a simple Dice game
[14:11] <kushal> ikshitij, What did you do over the weekend?
[14:12] <sayan> ikshitij: or rather last 2 days?
[14:12] <sayan> If you see jasonbraganza did 33 commits: https://github.com/jasonbraganza/mjbneue/commits/master
[14:12] <jasonbraganza> most of which are crap commits :P
[14:13] <sayan> jasonbraganza: yes, but they are commits. I would give you suggestions on what to change
[14:13] <kushal> jasonbraganza, Still better than most of these people here.
[14:13] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, I was happy to see your script running :)
[14:13] <sayan> jasonbraganza: that's the way to do, write small changes
[14:13] <kushal> There is blue pill for you all.
[14:13] <kushal> We can not make you learn everything in one hour.
[14:14] <sayan> I need proper reasons for me to take to class today?
[14:14] <jasonbraganza> sayan - like God told Abraham, I would do it for 5 good people? :P
[14:15] <kushal> jasonbraganza, we don't even have those 5
[14:15] <sayan> jasonbraganza: and people would lag and lag more
[14:16] <sayan> jasonbraganza: and then they won't understand stuffs
[14:16] <jasonbraganza> yikes
[14:17] <sayan> but they won't even ask questions
[14:17] <sayan> so, I am canceling the class for the day but people need to stay online and complete the task
[14:18] <sayan> and this is the last warning for all of you guys, all the tasks given in the class are IMPORTANT
[14:18] <sayan> and needs to be completed within the given time
[14:18] <sayan> Any questions
[14:20] <sayan> santoshShaw: what link did you post?
[14:20] <santoshShaw> I have missed some classes.So can I submit the assignments now?
[14:21] <sayan> santoshShaw: then why did you post an old repo?
[14:21] <santoshShaw> sayan sorry for the post
[14:22] <sayan> Okay, so those people who missed the class they need to post their links by tomorrow
[14:23] <santoshShaw> sayan : Thanks
[14:23] <sayan> ^^ I will be running the script that checks the attendence of the students through the logs
[14:23] <sayan> which will give who missed the classes
[14:24] <sayan> and those who did not I want in next 2-3 hours
[14:24] <sayan> if you have questions ask
[14:25] <jasonbraganza> speaking of kushal & sayan not being paid, itâs easy to underestimate the value of what they are teaching us.
[14:26] <asraisingh> sayan, I didn't attended complete previous session can I submit it by tomorrow?
[14:26] <asraisingh> I'm going through last session log.
[14:26] <jasonbraganza> trust me, a single online class membership is easily 2000 bucks a month. personal mentorship is 10 times that
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> a full semester like kushal and sayan teach, can easily run into lacs!
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> not counting the guests!
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> There is gold to be had here! for free! if only you invest the time!
[14:27] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, yes, you are right!
[14:27] <sayan> asraisingh: that would take 30 mins at max
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> </endrant>
[14:27] <kushal> jasonbraganza, that would be 4-5lakhs in total easily.
[14:28] <asraisingh> sayan, ok

[14:10] <fhackdroid> #startclass
[14:11] <skat-sd> !
[14:11] <fhackdroid> next
[14:11] <skat-sd> how do we control the 1st number?
[14:11] <fhackdroid> skat-sd, good question
[14:11] <fhackdroid> so range actually take three parameters
[14:12] <fhackdroid> first parameter is the number form which you want to initiate the range
[14:12] <fhackdroid> second number is the number till which that range should count excluding the number
[14:13] <fhackdroid> and third is the step
[14:13] <kushal> sayan, rtnpro fhackdroid we had documentation https://ircbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[14:13] <kushal> add: fhackdroid
[14:13] <kushal> masters
[14:13] <kushal> .masters
[14:13] <tenida> kushal: Error: "masters" is not a valid command.
[14:13] <skat-sd> ohh, like this: for i in range(1,10): print(i).  Got it
[14:13] <fhackdroid> skat-sd,  yes
[14:13] <skat-sd> thanks, fhackdroid
[14:14] <fhackdroid> skarpy, not only that but you can try something like range(1, 10, 2)
[14:14] <jasonbraganza> fhackdroid - in 2s?
[14:14] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, yes
[14:14] <jasonbraganza> got it
[14:14] <fhackdroid> try it :)
[14:14] <skarpy> Fhackdroid: ok
[14:15] <fhackdroid> hope you guys are clear with range ?
[14:15] <fhackdroid> yes ?
[14:15] <RIcharD_> Yes.
[14:15] <skarpy> yes
[14:15] <samridhia> yes
[14:15] <neer> Yes
[14:15] <atul916> yes
[14:15] <skat-sd> yes
[14:15] <fhackdroid> cool so lets do a simple problem ?
[14:15] <ashwanig> yes
[14:15] <devesh_V> Yes
[14:15] <knrai> yes
[14:15] <pr97> yes
[14:16] <soumam007> done
[14:16] <championshuttler> yes
[14:16] <asraisingh> yes
[14:17] <san-D> done
[14:17] <fhackdroid> The problem is called "Scooby Doo" Print numbers from 1 to 100 and for every number which is multiple of 3 print Scooby , for number multiple of 7 print Doo and for 3 and 7 print Scooby Doo
[14:18] <fhackdroid> is the question clear ? ^
[14:18] <asraisingh> yes
[14:19] <fhackdroid> paste your solution on fpaste and post a link here :)
[14:19] <bhavin192> If the number is 3 then it should print Scooby instead of 3, right?
[14:20] <fhackdroid> if the number is multiple of 3
[14:20] <fhackdroid> it should print scooby instead of 3
[14:20] <bhavin192> fhackdroid, we were using azure notebooks for Python sessions, should we use that?
[14:20] <kushal> bhavin192, YES
[14:20] <fhackdroid> bhavin192, anything works :)

[14:40] <RIcharD_> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/8bPkOFgFHHrhAdCLPQ3r-A
[14:40] <fhackdroid> I want your attention here
[14:40] <skarpy> fhackdroid: https://notebooks.azure.com/n/A0TVv10zWEg/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:40] <fhackdroid> say yes if you guys are paying attention
[14:40] <ashwanig> yes
[14:40] <schubisu> es
[14:40] <abhinavshirur> yes
[14:40] <schubisu> *yes
[14:40] <skarpy> Yes
[14:41] <asraisingh> yes
[14:41] <soumam007> yes
[14:41] <RIcharD_> yes
[14:41] <san-D> Yes
[14:41] <jasonbraganza> yes
[14:41] <neer> yes
[14:41] <anuGupta> Yes
[14:41] <fhackdroid> okay what I am going to say is not related to python but programming
[14:41] <fhackdroid> you guys are doing a hit and try
[14:42] <fhackdroid> if this works or it doesn't
[14:42] <fhackdroid> that is not how you should think
[14:42] <fhackdroid> even before you start writing code
[14:42] <fhackdroid> the solution should be clear in your mind
[14:42] <fhackdroid> think before you write
[14:43] <fhackdroid> give a read to the problem
[14:43] <fhackdroid> there is very important skill which is analyzing
[14:43] <pr97> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/4DJ1LzYIGbkZ6OyQYTPw6A
[14:43] <fhackdroid> think about the problem, see what are the condition
[14:43] <fhackdroid> think about the edge cases
[14:43] <ikshitij> https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/Scooby-Doo.ipynb
[14:44] <fhackdroid> where it can break
[14:44] <fhackdroid> learning a technology is like knowing the tool but even before using the tool you should know what you are using the tool for.
[14:45] <fhackdroid> Else it will be like a spanner in monkey's hand the only thing it can cause is a lot of things to break, Given that monkey is not experimental.
[14:45] <pr97> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/JyUCzTVEE5hJTphdwyXqHQ
[14:46] <fhackdroid> are you guys getting what I am trying to say ?
[14:46] <jasonbraganza> yes fhackdroid
[14:46] <anuGupta> Yes
[14:46] <pr97> yes
[14:46] <championshuttler> yes

[14:46] <atul916> sorry got disconnected can anyone give logs of last 8 min
[14:46] <san-D> yes
[14:47] <fhackdroid> so lets think logical here
[14:47] <fhackdroid> how many of you got the solution ?
[14:47] <jasonbraganza> me
[14:47] <neer> yes
[14:47] <championshuttler> atul916: check pm
[14:47] <championshuttler> me

[14:48] <jasonbraganza> i did
[14:48] <anuGupta> Me
[14:48] <asraisingh> i
[14:48] <RIcharD_> I did.

[14:48] <devesh_verma> I used and
[14:49] <fhackdroid> lets make it a little more fun
[14:49] <fhackdroid> do the same but this time you are not allowed to use the and operator
[14:49] <fhackdroid> is the question clear ?
[14:49] <jasonbraganza> san-D already had the solution
[14:49] <balaji> I used
[14:49] <jasonbraganza> iâd just be copying :)
[14:50] <RIcharD_> Yes
[14:50] <knrai> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/Eg3NDOBW9To/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:50] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, you shouldn't have told that :P
[14:50] <abhinavshirur> bhavin192 did that iirc :P
[14:50] <bhavin192> abhinavshirur, :-/
[14:51] <fhackdroid> okay good work people.
[14:51] <fhackdroid> so if you see the solution without and
[14:52] <neer> http://sprunge.us/EfjA
[14:52] <abhinavshirur> sorry :-/
[14:52] <fhackdroid> if you see this problem it is a very basic problem
[14:52] <fhackdroid> but not a lot of you got it in the first go
[14:53] <ikshitij> fhackdroid: We can use nested if else
[14:53] <fhackdroid> that happened because you were not thinking clearly
[14:53] <fhackdroid> this problem actually have a name
[14:53] <soumam007> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/YI5TngslL089PC1ZEE2MpQ
[14:53] <fhackdroid> does any of you know that ?
[14:54] <jasonbraganza> nope
[14:54] <anuGupta> !
[14:54] <skarpy> what is that name?
[14:54] <jasonbraganza> and please donât say PEBKAC
[14:55] <championshuttler> jasonbraganza: what is PEBKAC?
[14:56] <skarpy> championshuttler: google.
[14:56] <championshuttler> got it :) problem exists between keyboard and chair
[14:56] <fhackdroid> nobody knows what this problem is called ?
[14:56] <fhackdroid> cool let me give you something to search for
[14:56] <fhackdroid> this problem is called the fizz buzz problem
[14:57] <fhackdroid> this problem is called the fizz buzz problem
[14:57] <ikshitij> Oooh ! I solved the same on Hackerearth
[14:58] <soumam007> yeah fhackdroid got it
[14:58] <soumam007> :) dont know why they give such a typical name
[14:58] <ikshitij> Fizz Buzz Test
[14:59] <soumam007> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9461446/c-programming-the-fizzbuzz-program
[14:59] <jasonbraganza> fhackdroid - is that what we just did?
[14:59] <anuGupta> It's working for & too instead of and. Is this correct or not?
[15:00] <ashwanig> anuGupta, & is bitwise and not logical and
[15:00] <anuGupta> Yup but it gave the correct answer so asked
[15:00] <fhackdroid> ikshitij, yes
[15:00] <fhackdroid> any questions till now ?
[15:00] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, yes that is what you did :)
[15:00] <jasonbraganza> i always thought FizzBuzz was something complicated :P
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> !
[15:01] <fhackdroid> jasonbraganza, well you uncomplicated the complicated
[15:01] <fhackdroid> next
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> unrelated to the clas question
[15:01] <fhackdroid> next
[15:01] <jasonbraganza> how legal is it to use the youtube-dl module to download music lists? asking because samridhia is using the module as an example and Iâm worried for her. should she change her blog post?
[15:01] <pie3> which distributed services you know about/use/heard ? e.g. SVN is distributed
[15:01] <anuGupta> It's working for & too instead of and. Is this correct or not?
[15:02] <anuGupta> Why is it giving correct output<EOF>
[15:02] <fhackdroid> pie3, class is going on
[15:02] <ashwanig> anuGupta, You should figure it out why it is working. What is the result of 1&0?
[15:02] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, AFAIK it is not legal
[15:02] <pie3> how to jump into class
[15:03] <samridhia> jasonbraganza, are there any legal issues with modules too?
[15:03] <anuGupta> Oh yes thanks ashwanig
[15:03] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, she should read more about copyright
[15:03] <championshuttler> samridhia: legal issues are with dowloading content without permission i think
[15:03] <fhackdroid> anuGupta, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22646463/difference-between-and-boolean-vs-bitwise-in-python-why-difference-i
[15:03] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, samridhia, let's discuss it after class
[15:04] <jasonbraganza> samridhia, not the module, but *what* you download I think
[15:04] <anuGupta> Ok fhackdroid
[15:04] <samridhia> bhavin192, ok i will now read everything about copyright.
[15:04] <fhackdroid> hope that answers your question
[15:05] <ikshitij> jasonbraganza: downloading content from YouTube is illegal, doesn't matter you use x module or y module or you are FBI officer :)
[15:05] <fhackdroid> okay guys so do you guys know about the data structure called list in python ?

[13:48] <kvy_> kushal,ikshitij   It work in online compilers but while i code this in a .py file and run it in terminal it show error
[13:49] <kushal> kvy_, Compilers?
[13:49] <san-D> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/LtqI6fzgyMc/notebooks/pythonPractice.ipynb
[13:49] <kushal> knrai, ashwanig nice
[13:49] <kushal> https://notebooks.azure.com/san-D/libraries/san-D/html/pythonPractice.ipynb this looks weird to anyone?
[13:49] <kvy_> kushal I mean in notebook.
[13:50] <san-D> oops sory!
[13:50] <soumam007> roll call: Soumam Banerjee
[13:50] <skarpy> kushal also to mention, I am doing code in Python, converted to lua.
[13:50] <kushal> skarpy, I have no clue about it.
[13:50] <skarpy> Kushal: its lua coding.
[13:50] <kushal> skarpy, So now you have answer.
[13:50] <ashwanig> kushal, Isn't it wrong syntax?
[13:50] <kushal> ashwanig, yup
[13:50] <kushal> next
[13:50] <pr97> How to take inputs on a single line in python?
[13:51] <avik> kushal, what are we suppose to do?
[13:51] <avik> sorry for being late!
[13:51] <san-D> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/LtqI6fzgyMc/notebooks/pythonPractice.ipynb
[13:51] <kushal> avik, wait and see
[13:51] <avik> what is the question?
[13:51] <anuGupta> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/5UnzfsgbnB4UEACtjILmzA
[13:52] <kushal> avik, convert a list of strings to int.
[13:52] <san-D> why is it not showing my modified code?
[13:52] <ashwanig> anuGupta, Your program isn't converting the list of strings into list of integers
[13:52] <san-D> again
[13:52] <schubisu> san-D: that doesn't look like python code to me ;) what are you trying to do?
[13:52] <kushal> Anyone.
[13:52] <ikshitij> skarpy: discuss after class
[13:52] <kushal> oops
[13:52] <kushal> pr97, use the input function call
[13:52] <ikshitij> I am not getting what exactly you want skarpy
[13:53] <san-D> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/LtqI6fzgyMc/notebooks/pythonPractice.ipynb
[13:53] <skarpy> ikshitij: I will explain to you in person. Now to the class.
[13:53] <ikshitij> pr97: use map ( )
[13:53] <anuGupta> Ooh so for that map function can be used
[13:53] <pr97> kushal, sorry, didn't get you
[13:53] <avik> please, can someone repeat the question to be solved!
[13:53] <pr97> map() function is not clear to me
[13:53] <schubisu> san-D: now it's updated. You should avoid variable names like 'list', it is a researved keyword in python
[13:54] <kushal> pr97, Use the input function call.
[13:54] <ashwanig> pr97, You can use `elements = input().split()`
[13:54] <kushal> avik, I just wrote the question to you.
[13:54] <kushal> next
[13:54] <championshuttler> !
[13:54] <avik> never got that!
[13:54] <avik> sorry!
[13:54] <pr97> ashwanig,  if you have to take 50 inputs, then?
[13:55] <avik> ok on it now!
[13:55] <pr97> okay kushal
[13:55] <avik> kushal, thanks<eom>
[13:55] <ashwanig> pr97, 50 inputs in same line?
[13:55] <pr97> okay ikshitij
[13:55] <ikshitij> pr97: https://notebooks.azure.com/n/PMlQyZdJoH0/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[13:55] <pr97> ashwanig,  yes
[13:55] <ikshitij> Last line
[13:55] <kushal> Okay, people stop for now.
[13:55] <pr97> okay thank you ikshitij
[13:57] <anuGupta> ikshitij it's private
[13:57] <pr97> ikshitij,  yes, not opening
[13:58] <kushal> What was the last thing fhackdroid discussed on Monday? loops?
[13:58] <ashwanig> Yes, for loop
[13:58] <anuGupta> List
[13:59] <ashwanig> anuGupta, ?
[13:59] <ikshitij> https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[13:59] <kushal> https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datastructure.html  start reading from here.
[13:59] <ikshitij> List
[13:59] <avik> https://notebooks.azure.com/technotron/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[13:59] <kushal> There maybe things which you do not understand, feel free to come here and ask.
[14:00] <kushal> I will be waiting for questions.
[14:00] <kushal> Along with your questions, please show us the notebook link
[14:00] <kushal> so that can we can see what have you tried
[14:00] <skarpy> !
[14:01] <balaji> !
[14:03] <kushal> next
[14:04] <kushal> next
[14:04] <skarpy> Kushal: how can I have packages in notebook? I am using numpy and scipy in my IDE.
[14:04] <championshuttler> doubt cleared :)
[14:04] <kushal> skarpy, no clue, you will have to search.
[14:05] <skarpy> Kushal: we have to code only on available packages? We can't add new?
[14:05] <skarpy> Kushal: ok
[14:05] <kushal> skarpy, Btw, when you say notebook, you mean Azure notebook, not the notebook in your laptop, correct?
[14:05] <skarpy> Kushal: yes azure notebook :p
[14:05] <kushal> skarpy, I will ask the people who wrote/manage Azure notebook.
[14:05] <kvy_> !
[14:05] <kushal> skarpy, but, generally, you can just pip install
[14:05] <kushal> skarpy, try !pip install whatever
[14:05] <kushal> next
[14:05] <balaji> Is that list is something similar to array?
[14:06] <kushal> balaji, Yes sir :)
[14:06] <kushal> sorry for saying sir.
[14:06] <skarpy> Kushal: pip in azure notebook?????
[14:06] <kushal> balaji, But, yes.
[14:06] <kushal> skarpy, look at the syntax I gave.
[14:06] <skarpy> Kushal: ok
[14:06] <kushal> skarpy, if you read about how Jupyter works, you will know.
[14:07] <kvy_> we do not code any function but we can insert or append any data how it's working ?
[14:07] <ikshitij> skarpy: All useful libraries used for data science is installed already.
[14:07] <kvy_> <eof>
[14:07] <skarpy> Kushal: yes I forgot about google :p <eom>
[14:07] <balaji> okay kushal
[14:07] <kushal> next
[14:07] <kvy_> we do not code any function but we can insert or append any data how it's working ?
[14:07] <kvy_> <eof>
[14:08] <kushal> kvy_, Because the people who wrote Python programming language, already wrote those for you.
[14:08] <kushal> kvy_, Just like the for loop.
[14:08] <kvy_> It's cool
[14:08] <kushal> kvy_, Yes, it  is :)
[14:08] <kushal> next
[14:10] <ikshitij> skarpy: I just installed a packages in my notebook. Check https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:11] <skarpy> Ikshitij: thank you :)
[14:12] <kushal> ikshitij, it tells me there is an error :)
[14:13] <ikshitij> Error in link that I shared ?
[14:13] <balaji> ikshitij, Yes
[14:14] <balaji> Make sure that is public
[14:14] <avik> !
[14:15] <ikshitij> Ok checking
[14:15] <ikshitij> !
[14:15] <kushal> next
[14:15] <avik> what does end = '  ' actually doing? https://notebooks.azure.com/technotron/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:16] <pr97> same doubt as avik
[14:17] <kushal> avik, try these two
[14:17] <kushal> for i in range(10):
[14:17] <kushal>     print(i)
[14:17] <kushal> and then
[14:17] <kushal> for i in range(10):
[14:17] <kushal>     print(i, end=' ')
[14:17] <kushal> try and see :)
[14:17] <avik> ok!
[14:18] <avik> yes, '\n' is not there, right?
[14:19] <avik> kushal, ? ^^
[14:19] <kushal> avik, now, try help(print)
[14:19] <ikshitij> avik: we discussed already about this last class. :)
[14:19] <kushal> avik, in your terminal :)
[14:20] <kushal> ikshitij, Some people just don't read the logs or the sessions when they are live.
[14:20] <avik> ok. saw that
[14:20] <kushal> next
[14:20] <kvy_> avik,pr97  I think it help to print output horizontal .
[14:20] <avik> kushal, sorry for that!
[14:20] <kushal> avik, You don't have to say sorry.
[14:20] <ikshitij> In students.py example, what is that sum ( ) function for ? It's not defined anywhere in that particular problem
[14:20] <pr97> yes kvy_
[14:21] <kushal> ikshitij, means it is already written :)
[14:21] <kushal> ikshitij, try help(sum) in your terminal :)
[14:21] <ikshitij> Ok
[14:21] <atul916> !
[14:22] <ikshitij> Got it kushal
[14:22] <kushal> next
[14:22] <atul916> how is divmod function being used?
[14:22] <avik> !
[14:23] <kushal> atul916, that is an easy way to get answers of  two operations in one function call
[14:23] <kushal> next
[14:23] <avik> "flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream." what does this mean?
[14:24] <kvy_> atul916   I think it return 2 value reminder and another is result of there divide.
[14:25] <kushal> avik, so you can use print function to any file like object, say a file on the drive.
[14:25] <ikshitij> avik: print(var_name, end = ' '). It will append space in last. You can add a line break and tab using end = '\n' and end = '\t' at respectively
[14:26] <kushal> avik, and when you write to a file, it is on the kernel to decide when to write the content to the actual drive, it may just return saying writing is successful, but maybe it is writing only when you are closing the file.
[14:26] <avik> kushal, can you please explain that a little more?
[14:26] <kushal> avik, you can try to force that with a flush
[14:26] <avik> never mind, got it!
[14:27] <avik> kushal, thanks.
[14:27] <kushal> avik, also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10545167/what-does-it-mean-to-flush-file-contents-in-python#10545247
[14:27] <avik> ikshitij, got that!
[14:27] <kushal> next
[14:27] <kushal> okay
[14:28] <kvy_> atul916   It is use as a,b = divmod(10,2)  now a = 5 and b = 0.
[14:28] <avik> kushal, is it like fflush in c?
[14:28] <kushal> avik, you are answering your own questions.
[14:28] <avik> hehe!
[14:32] <kushal> anyway, others please ask what ever you want to.
[14:35] <ikshitij> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/b0CJmSpRBQ0~zBto0p3CZw
[14:35] <ikshitij> I am getting error in this
[14:35] <ikshitij> sorry fixed
[14:35] <kushal> :)
[14:37] <championshuttler> !
[14:38] <ikshitij> !
[14:40] <ikshitij> In dictionaries, if we want to check data for particular key, we use data[key]. What If I want to see key for a particular data.
[14:40] <kushal> ikshitij, wait
[14:41] <kushal> to check if a key exists or not, check with if statement
[14:41] <kushal> if key in data:
[14:41] <kushal>   print("Yes")
[14:41] <ikshitij> Like I want to check who use Fedora !
[14:41] <ikshitij> It should return Kushal
[14:43] <kushal> ikshitij, so maintain another dictionary where the values from here are the keys, and the values are list of users.
[14:44] <ikshitij> Ok
[14:44] <kushal> ikshitij, or you have to loop through all the values.
[14:45] <ikshitij> Loop through all the key and check the value, if it's equal to required value, return key
[14:49] <ikshitij> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/PVVp8kyRlBmiONtEc574Aw
[14:50] <ikshitij> kushal: solved
[14:50] <kushal> next
[14:50] <championshuttler> how to print result of loop on same line?
[14:50] <kushal> mext
[14:50] <kushal> next
[14:50] <kushal> championshuttler, end argument in the print function
[14:50] <kushal> championshuttler, see the discussion with avik a few minutes back
[14:51] <championshuttler> kushal ok :) will read logs after uploading loosing connection again and again
[14:52] <kushal> championshuttler, okay
[14:58] <yurii> I was disconected for 20 minutes, is session going on
[14:59] <kvy_> yurii ya session is going on
[14:59] <kushal> next
[14:59] <ikshitij> championshuttler: use "print(i, end = ' ')" It will print output on the same line adding spaces between them. Pass different parameters for different results
[15:02] <CHOCOS1> yes yurii
[15:04] <kushal> Anyway, seems everyone is busy reading./
[15:04] <championshuttler> ikshitij: thanks :)
[15:04] <kushal> So, to make people actually talk, I will end the session now, and expect people to stay online and ask doubts to friends here (we will also help).
[15:04] <kushal> Roll Call
[15:04] <kushal> I guess people are busy.

[15:28] <kushal> Okay.
[15:28] <kushal> Before we take questions, you can see there was enough time to discuss between all participants, but there were not many questions.
[15:28] <kushal> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/1AFFhbd6xdXmNJvnMzZeEQ/raw
[15:28] <kushal> There is a list l.
[15:29] <kushal> Which has a few English words.
[15:29] <devesh[m]> Devesh Verma
[15:30] <kushal> Write some code (using whatever is taught till now) on your notebook, and tell us which two words has highest usages?
[15:31] <anuGupta> Anu kumari Gupta
[15:32] <pr97> Priyanka Sharma
[15:32] <avik> kushal, what do you mean by usages?
[15:32] <avik> where to tally from?

[15:48] <kushal> checking
[15:48] <anuGupta> Sorry once again my variable names are not correct
[15:48] <anuGupta> Apologies
[15:48] <kushal> It is confusing to read.
[15:49] <kushal> anuGupta, now suggestion: Use a dictionary to have each word as a key, and the number of times you see them is a value.
[15:49] <san-D> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/huqBE3doFt4/notebooks/pythonPractice.ipynb

[15:54] <ashwanig> san-D, It is accessible now. I got the same output. Let kushal check :)
[15:54] <san-D> :)
[15:55] <kushal> san-D, when you are creating tuples, good idea is to put them inside of ()
[15:55] <kushal> first = ("". 0)
[15:55] <kushal> and same
[15:55] <san-D> kushal: ok

[16:02] <san-D> knrai: good logic :)
[16:04] <ashwanig> knrai, Just a suggestion, don't you think `s` should have a better name?
[16:05] <knrai> ashwanig: yup
[16:06] <ashwanig> !
[16:07] <kushal> next
[16:07] <ashwanig> When I am trying `for word, frequency in frequency_table:` I get a ValueError
[16:08] <ashwanig> it tells me that too many values to unpack. Why is that? <eof>
[16:11] <kushal> ashwanig, means frequency_table has more than 3 times for each item :)
[16:11] <kushal> Anyway, for everyone, https://notebooks.azure.com/kushaldas/libraries/dgplug
[16:11] <kushal> check the summer training notebook
[16:12] <kushal> This should have a words dict which contains the details
[16:13] <kushal> tell me if you can not see that
[16:13] <Phi_mb> #hello everyone :)
[16:14] <bhavin192> kushal, sorry, I was not able to complete the task as I was travelling. but I was thinking about the logic
[16:16] <Phi_mb> I am thinking to switch to linux distro other than ubuntu, any suggestions?  I am confused between debian, fedora and out of curiousity RHEL. :)
[16:21] <anuGupta> !
[16:22] <avik> https://notebooks.azure.com/technotron/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[16:22] <avik> kushal, ^^
[16:23] <kushal> Phi_mb, there is a session going on, so ask later.
[16:23] <kushal> avik, Okay
[16:23] <kushal> next
[16:23] <Phi_mb> kushal: oops sorry,
[16:23] <kushal> People please have a look at my summertraining notebook
[16:24] <anuGupta> Although it's absurd but if I know the value in a dictionary, can I access somehow the key?
[16:24] <kushal> anuGupta, you will have to loop though all the key/value combination to do that.
[16:24] <kushal> anuGupta, Please have a look at the code I wrote
[16:25] <avik> !
[16:25] <ashwanig> kushal, understood
[16:25] <kushal> I am pasting here for later reference
[16:25] <kushal> words = {}  # Empty dictionary
[16:25] <kushal> for word in l:
[16:25] <kushal>     if word in words:

[16:25] <kushal> print(list_of_words[0], list_of_words[1])
[16:25] <kushal> next
[16:26] <avik> a very stupid question : how can I learn to think simple? the way you did
[16:26] <ashwanig> kushal, I didn't use `frequency_table.items()` so was getting that error
[16:26] <kushal> avik, Takes time, and you will have to read a lot of code, and then write some also
[16:26] <ikshitij> Aah I missed today's session.
[16:26] <kushal> ashwanig, otherwise you were only getting the key.
[16:26] <avik> okay! a long road ahead! :D
[16:26] <kushal> ikshitij, It is still going on.
[16:26] <kushal> avik, Yes.
[16:27] <ikshitij> Ok kushal

[16:27] <kushal> next
[16:27] <ashwanig> `list_of_words = [(word[1],word[0]) for word in words.items()]` - what is this line doing? <eof>
[16:28] <kushal> ashwanig, let us split that line.
[16:28] <kushal> words.items()
[16:28] <kushal> What does this function do?
[16:28] <kushal> ashwanig, ^^
[16:28] <ashwanig> kushal, we get key,value pairs
[16:28] <kushal> Okay, good.
[16:28] <kushal> next
[16:28] <kushal> oops
[16:29] <kushal> for word in words.items --- what is this?
[16:29] <kushal> A for loop, where we will get a tuple everytime, containing key, value.
[16:29] <kushal> ashwanig, ^^ correct?
[16:29] <ashwanig> iterating each key,value pair at a time in the dictionary word
[16:29] <kushal> ashwanig, Correct
[16:29] <ashwanig> yes
[16:29] <kushal> So, I could add those tuples in a list by this
[16:30] <kushal> list_of_words = []
[16:30] <ashwanig> ah, understood :)
[16:30] <kushal> for word in words.items():
[16:30] <jasonbraganza> kushal - what is the else doing?
[16:30] <pie3> how to get list of friends in hexchat?
[16:30] <kushal>     list_of_words.append(word[1], word[0])
[16:31] <ashwanig> kushal, got it :)
[16:31] <kushal> ashwanig, now, I wrote that in a simple way using list comprehension
[16:31] <kushal> :)
[16:31] <kushal> jasonbraganza, What was your question?
[16:32] <jasonbraganza> still trying to grasp the dictionary creation part
[16:32] <jasonbraganza> i got the for part
[16:32] <jasonbraganza> i do not understand wgat the else is for?
[16:32] <jasonbraganza> i mean what the else condition does
[16:32] <ashwanig> jasonbraganza, when a new word occurs which is not in the dictionary
[16:33] <kushal> else:
[16:33] <kushal>         words[word] = 1
[16:33] <kushal> this one?
[16:33] <jasonbraganza> yes
[16:33] <jasonbraganza> oh wait!
[16:33] <kushal> If the key is not the words, means we are encountering the word for the first time
[16:33] <jasonbraganza> I got it backwards
[16:33] <jasonbraganza> the for condition is counting and appending the count
[16:33] <kushal> so setting the count as 1 for that word.
[16:33] <jasonbraganza> of occurenses
[16:33] <jasonbraganza> the else takes care of every new word like ashwanig says
[16:34] <kushal> jasonbraganza, Yes.
[16:34] <jasonbraganza> ok. now to figure out the next part.
[16:35] <jasonbraganza> nope. kushal help
[16:35] <jasonbraganza> what is this doing? list_of_words = [(word[1],word[0]) for word in words.items()]
[16:35] <kushal> jasonbraganza, ask
[16:35] <jasonbraganza> i got the other two lines
[16:35] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, I'm not able to understand that too
[16:35] <kushal> jasonbraganza, I just explained that to ashwanig above.
[16:35] <jasonbraganza> ver sorry
[16:35] <jasonbraganza> will read
[16:35] <kushal> jasonbraganza, read the log please :)
[16:36] <kushal> Everyone, next start reading the strings chapter https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strings.html
[16:37] <kushal> the session is continuing
[16:37] <kushal> I am not closing it.
[16:37] <kushal> ask questions here.
[16:39] <jasonbraganza> kushal - I got it and kind of understood it.
[16:39] <jasonbraganza> but i definitely need practice
[16:40] <ashwanig> jasonbraganza, if you have any doubts we can discuss it
[16:41] <jasonbraganza> nope. just a matter of me having to break it down and build it up fluently
[16:46] <anuGupta> I have a doubt
[16:47] <kushal> jasonbraganza, you will have to do it 10 times in next 4 months
[16:47] <kushal> anuGupta, ask
[16:47] <jasonbraganza> kushal totally agree.
[16:47] <anuGupta> Can we sort a dictionary ?
[16:47] <kushal> anuGupta, we just did that
[16:48] <kushal> anuGupta, But, there are other ways
[16:48] <anuGupta> You created a tupple before that
[16:48] <kushal> anuGupta, I will leave that to you :)
[16:48] <kushal> anuGupta, To think about how sort works tec
[16:48] <kushal> etc
[16:48] <anuGupta> Ok kushal
[16:48] <anuGupta> :)
[16:52] <bhavin192> Impressive! it sorts the list using first value from the tuple
[16:55] <bhavin192> and uses next value if there is a tie
[16:58] <ashwanig> bhavin192, yes
[17:03] <kushal> Ending the session, please ask if you have any questions

[14:05] <ikshitij> Index out of range
[14:07] <kushal> ikshitij, yes, the last line is an empty line :)
[14:07] <ikshitij> Oo
[14:07] <ashwanig> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/f9UiCO6OxKlj5jQrzie2Pw
[14:08] <kushal> ashwanig, yes, checked
[14:08] <kushal> ashwanig, those print function calls look bad
[14:08] <asraisingh> kushal: error corrected, https://notebooks.azure.com/n/9vUasNwt1yg/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:08] <kushal> You can make them better
[14:08] <ashwanig> kushal, ok should I use .format() ?
[14:09] <kushal> ashwanig, yes, better
[14:09] <kushal> asraisingh, not correct answer, I can see some random numbers
[14:10] <kushal> asraisingh, You will have to give an output which makes sense.
[14:10] <kushal> Here I don't know which line is what.

[14:14] <ikshitij> Done
[14:15] <ashwanig> knrai1, the results will be integers not float
[14:16] <ashwanig> ikshitij, We have to convert the memory values into MBs
[14:21] <championshuttler> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/9vUasNwt1yg/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb how to convert this data to an array , i am getting error
[14:22] <ikshitij> kushal: Working https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:23] <bhavin192> https://notebooks.azure.com/bhavin192/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:23] <knrai1> ashwanig: okay
[14:23] <kushal> championshuttler, we don'
[14:23] <kushal> championshuttler, we don't have normal array in Python
[14:24] <championshuttler> kushal: ok i am trying to do but getting error, is there anyway?
[14:24] <jasonbraganza> for once, I think I got something running
[14:24] <jasonbraganza> please check - https://notebooks.azure.com/jasonbraganza/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:25] <deepika_> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/nlnVjJirBnQ/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:26] <ikshitij> kushal: https://notebooks.azure.com/kshitiz/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb Corrected again
[14:27] <kushal> jasonbraganza, total_memory = (split_lines[0])  you can just write total_memory = split_lines[0]
[14:27] <kushal> Now for a line like
[14:27] <kushal> "MemTotal:        7858500 kB"
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> i donât know why i keep doing that. sorry. will go fix
[14:28] <kushal> what is the best way to split?
[14:28] <kushal> People please discuss
[14:28] <jasonbraganza> i couldnât quite figure out so I mashed last timeâs expression :)
[14:29] <ashwanig> kushal, for that we can use line.split(':')
[14:30] <ikshitij> split("\n")
[14:30] <ashwanig> ikshitij, Won't that return the original line itself?
[14:30] <kushal> ikshitij, where do you find the "\n"
[14:30] <kushal> ashwanig, :D
[14:31] <yurii> I think the same  -- line.split(':')
[14:31] <jasonbraganza> ashwanig - yes! i forogot!
[14:31] <jasonbraganza> s /forogot /forgot
[14:31] <ikshitij> That was an example
[14:31] <ikshitij> :)
[14:33] <ashwanig> !
[14:33] <schubisu> that would have been my solution https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/znTvZfC09w4F-KaCvmLTVw
[14:34] <bhavin192> I did lines.split() and then checked the words
[14:35] <ashwanig> sorry asking out of turn, Is there any function to remove those spaces from the middle without splitting?
[14:35] <ikshitij> kushal: I stored lines in word by line.split(":") and then replaced all spaces by using replace(" ","")
[14:36] <ikshitij> Then stored word and size in Dictionary as key and value respectively
[14:36] <ikshitij> Is this okay
[14:39] <kushal> ikshitij, there can be different ways
[14:39] <ashwanig> ikshitij, nice method :)
[14:40] <kushal> schubisu, alao print what is what
[14:40] <ikshitij> kushal: okay
[14:41] <bhavin192> Using indexes directly makes reading the code a little hard, like word[0]; what do you think guys?
[14:41] <ashwanig> bhavin192, yes, I also have this doubt
[14:41] <anuGupta> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/MBHpc8gojiM/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:43] <ikshitij> bhavin192: but what, when we have two values only in list, running loop unnecessarily is also not a good idea
[14:43] <ikshitij> I am in doubt for this
[14:44] <bhavin192> ikshitij, you can always add comments or new variables may be like some_index = number
[14:44] <bhavin192> I'm not sure though
[14:44] <kushal> bhavin192, if you know the data, you can do that
[14:44] <kushal> with comments
[14:45] <kushal> Just use index numbers but with comments
[14:47] <ashwanig> kushal, next problem?
[14:47] <bhavin192> kushal, what do you think about this the `buffer_index` https://notebooks.azure.com/bhavin192/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:47] <schubisu> kushal: sorry, what do you mean with print what is what? Add comments?
[14:47] <kushal> Is anyone have any other questions?
[14:48] <kushal> schubisu, like what output is the free memory
[14:48] <kushal> "Free memory"
[14:48] <anuGupta> Is mine correct?
[14:48] <bhavin192> anuGupta, you are missing spaces around operators
[14:49] <kushal> anuGupta, and also the code looks scary
[14:49] <anuGupta> Split is not splitting ":"
[14:49] <kushal> anuGupta, example?
[14:49] <bhavin192> listing=lines.split() <- anuGupta
[14:49] <schubisu> kushal: it should be in there. Sorry for not posting in a notebook so you can't see on one glance.
[14:50] <anuGupta> Example "me mTotal:" is one of the element of the list
[14:50] <kushal> schubisu, Okay
[14:50] <ashwanig> bhavin192, if you are extracting the substring before the for loop, then what is the need for this `if word.find(":") != -1:` ?
[14:50] <kushal> Every
[14:50] <kushal> Everyone, try not to use a loop
[14:50] <kushal> as this is a fixed data
[14:51] <bhavin192> ashwanig, I'm removing the buffers part only
[14:51] <anuGupta> Kushal, What exactly is scary? I hear this in my every code.
[14:51] <bhavin192> ashwanig, then checking if the word has ":"
[14:52] <bhavin192> anuGupta, have you read my message?
[14:52] <anuGupta> bhavin192, I am using .split() only
[14:52] <bhavin192> <bhavin192> anuGupta, you are missing spaces around operators <bhavin192> listing=lines.split() <- anuGupta
[14:53] <ikshitij> anuGupta: you should give space after operator
[14:53] <ashwanig> bhavin192, Every combination has that, then why checking?
[14:53] <ikshitij> x == 7 not x==7
[14:53] <ikshitij> anuGupta:
[14:53] <anuGupta> Ooh
[14:53] <bhavin192> ashwanig, I'm splitting with .split(), so I have kB as well
[14:54] <bhavin192> ashwanig, to avoid that
[14:54] <anuGupta> Thank you
[14:54] <ashwanig> bhavin192, Oh got it
[14:55] <deepika_> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/nlnVjJirBnQ/notebooks/summertraining.ipynb
[14:56] <ikshitij> ashwanig: how to pass multiple argument in .replace()
[14:56] <ashwanig> ikshitij, what will it do?
[14:57] <ikshitij> https://notebooks.azure.com/n/TB0RRLB9wtM/notebooks/stringProblem.ipynb
[14:57] <kushal> laptop crashed, will take 2 minutes
[14:57] <ikshitij> Check comment with line 1 and line 2 written
[14:57] <kushal> anuGupta, I will answer you
[14:57] <kushal> anuGupta, for example
[14:57] <kushal> if(listing[i].isdigit()==True):
[14:58] <kushal> if statement does not need ()
[14:58] <kushal> so that statement becomes if listing[i].isdigit()==True :
[14:58] <kushal> now
[14:58] <kushal> anuGupta, if you remember https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ifelse.html#truth-value-testing
[14:58] <kushal> that line can now become
[14:58] <kushal> if listing[i].isdigit():
[14:59] <kushal> anuGupta, Isn't that cleaner?
[14:59] <anuGupta> Yes kushal
[14:59] <anuGupta> Understood
[14:59] <kushal> listing[i]=str(round(int(listing[i])/1024)) + "  "
[14:59] <kushal> I can only imagine what it is doing
[14:59] <kushal> anuGupta, remove the loop
[14:59] <kushal> don't use any loop
[14:59] <kushal> and then try to rewrite that oce
[14:59] <kushal> code
[14:59] <anuGupta> Ook correcting
[15:00] <anuGupta> S/ook/ok
[15:00] <kushal> anuGupta, your code is correct, but looks like C than python
[15:00] <ikshitij> kushal I think this code is converting list item into integer then again to string after division
[15:00] <ikshitij> Am I right ?
[15:00] <anuGupta> Yes ikshitij
[15:01] <kushal> Tonight problem
[15:01] <ikshitij> why string again ? We can store integer into list also @anuGupta
[15:01] <kushal> Take the whole file as a string in triple quotes from https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2017/Logs-2017-06-18-13-41.txt
[15:02] <kushal> and then write a code, which will tell me, 1. How many total different nicks were present in that log
[15:02] <anuGupta> When I am joining back to string , it requires all the elements to be string
[15:02] <kushal> who spoke how many lines
[15:02] <kushal> and how many words
[15:02] <kushal> 3 things
[15:02] <kushal> roll call
[15:02] <kvy> ikshitij we have something more strong then link-list.

[13:29] <mbuf> Today will be a retrospection session
[13:30] <mbuf> It has been at least two months since the summer training began, and you have been attending classes, guest sessions, doing exercises, reading, watching videos etc.
[13:30] <mbuf> So, I would like each one of you to answer the following three questions
[13:30] <san-D> Sandesh Patel
[13:31] <mbuf> 1. How have you benefited from the summer training till date (or how different are you from the time you joined the training)? 2. What is it that you didn't like or would want to change in the training? 3. What do you want to do next?
[13:31] <mbuf> We can then take our discussions based on the responses
[13:31] <mbuf> Feel free to give an honest reply, because it is important for you and for us
[13:32] <mbuf> You can take your time to formulate the answers
[13:33] <skarpy> Akash pathak
[13:33] <priyansh> Priyansh Sourav
[13:33] <skarpy> Should we write the answers here? @mbuf
[13:33] <mbuf> skarpy, yes
[13:34] <knrai_> roll: Krishnanand Rai
[13:34] <asraisingh> Before joining this training session I only know the basic meaning of FOSS that it is free and anyone can contribute to it. But after joining the session I get to know that what is the history behind FOSS, how FOSS developed. What's the basic requirement to start any open source project. Now I am able to understand the need of the documentation as well as how to write it.
[13:34] <mbuf> For those who joined late, today is a retrospection session. Please answer the following three questions
[13:34] <mbuf>  1. How have you benefited from the summer training till date (or how different are you from the time you joined the training)? 2. What is it that you didn't like or would want to change in the training? 3. What do you want to do next?
[13:35] <knrai> Krishnanand Rai
[13:35] <mbuf> asraisingh, please mark the answer with the number 1, 2 or 3.
[13:35] <yurii> 1. Start to learn and (continue to learn) Rst, ssh, gpg, git, gitHub, vim, emacs, python , doing gtypist etc.
[13:35] <asraisingh> ok , above answer is for 1st question.
[13:35] <mbuf> asraisingh, okay
[13:37] <mbuf> yurii, you have note used the above tools before?

[13:38] <yurii> Before  I only hear about it but never have used
[13:38] <samridhia> 1. This summer training has helped me improve a lot, not only in coding but many aspects like How to do a proper conversation, How to write proper mails, How to learn new things from all the session mates and making blogs a regular practice. When i joined the session i was at the basic level of many things like git, GitHub, Vim etc. these were the topics which i always searched for in the internet but never got a well enough documentation to learn the
[13:38] <samridhia> m properly. Here i learned all those things which i always though will be so hard to learn.
[13:38] <mbuf> yurii, good
[13:39] <anuGupta> I had had never such training ever in my life. Even paid trainings are not as good as dgplug summer training. dgplug is far way beyond those. From knowing nothing of what FOSS meant to the time now, it made a drastic change in me. I felt there are lots of things to be done and learn and this community just gave a spark in me. To a complete beginner to open source, know I am learning things which are beyond most of the people's r
[13:39] <mbuf> samridhia, that is good
[13:39] <mbuf> anuGupta, that is true; our focus is to trigger the spark in you
[13:39] <mbuf> anuGupta, even we are learning every day, and we also want you to learn every day
[13:40] <mbuf> anuGupta, that is our focus and objective
[13:40] <yurii> 1. Also I  start to write blog (sorry not to much)
[13:40] <mbuf> yurii, that is a good habit
[13:41] <anuGupta> I am very much lucky to learn remarkable things from remarkable people.
[13:41] <yurii> 1.Start to understand how community communicate and  how to contribute
[13:41] <mbuf> anuGupta, so, how are you putting whatever you have learnt to practice?
[13:42] <anuGupta> Exploring things and most of all switching to Linux and using it.
[13:42] <soumam007> I have been benefited immensely from this summer training , I had no idea regarding the philosophy of open sourcing which i learned here.I understood the importance of terminal , package manager. learned to use rst,md, fpasting :) , blogging(though havent done much),python especially, git and githubwhich i was trying to learn since 10 months, and most importantly Fedora 26 and leaving windows :P,i learnt that terminal could be shared. Now this was a
[13:42] <soumam007> quantitaive analysis but if seen from knowledge point of view what i learnt in this 2 months i havent learn in 2years of my college and one most important thing the guidelines to talk,how to ask questions (i mean each and everything was just very very benificial). I just open the #dgplug i learn something be it within class or not
[13:43] <mbuf> Learning is a continuous process, and we will continue to read more books, blogs, and other sources of information, while, also watching videos
[13:44] <mbuf> soumam007, everybody learns at a different pace, so we try to go at a reasonable pace where everyone can follow and catch-up if they miss sessions
[13:44] <pr97> 1. I have known alot of things from this summer training. I am learning python, and i have taken a step forward for doing some small projects.
[13:44] <pr97> I have known about Open source software. Before this training, I don't know much about that. This summer training has enhanced my technical communication. I have improved alot from this training that I was before. I wrote blogs, known about git, VCS.
[13:44] <mbuf> soumam007, the important point to be noted here is that the IRC logs are available, os in future, anyone can refer to it
[13:44] <mbuf> pr97, good to know!
[13:45] <soumam007> yes mbuf thats a very good idea so that future generations can benefit from it
[13:45] <ravindra> 1.Though I have some experience in programming re visiting the concept is important and from communication to python and concepts like gpg ,git and all the other tools required for FOSS contribution boosted my confidence
[13:45] <mbuf> In a F/OSS culture, there are best practices that are recommended, and hence we encourage everyone to follow that; the tools, workflows are designed after much experimentation and success, and hence the recommendation
[13:45] <ikshitij> 1. I came to know about various tools like git, ViM, Github. Also, This training also taught me how development works, working with community and communication skills (That's most important working in a community), sharing your work and ideas with the world by writing a blog, importance of documentation.
[13:46] <mbuf> ravindra, the most important step is the first step; we start with basics because it gives people the confidence and boost's their morale; that is a very important ingredient
[13:46] <ikshitij> 2. A common platform, Where you can submit your tasks and mentors will give review
[13:46] <anuGupta> Nothing is which I disliked about dgplug.What I disliked is within me that I am unable to understand certain things. Like you people put in so hard efforts to make us learn but it has been always my fault to grasp it very slowly. I sometimes get disheartened when I don't understand but I believe that someday or the other things would change. There are a lot to learn and I just feel I know so less. Never did I disliked anything a
[13:46] <ikshitij> 3. I want to work and contribute to the various Open source project, that I use daily. SymPy is one of them
[13:46] <mbuf> ikshitij, this depends on the project in hand; we don't want to force any tool on the project or the individual
[13:47] <ikshitij> mbuf: I meant VCS, editor
[13:47] <mbuf> anuGupta, so what steps have you taken to better understand the concepts which are not clear to you?
[13:47] <bhavin192> 1. I wanted to talk about this from last few days, I can see lot of change in me, first thing is my English or the way I communicate with others is improved a lot (still trying to talk more politely) I have started using git for almost everything, like even for small scripts or project. More importantly now I write more detailed README files with proper license to the code. Whenever I do something new or find something new I t
[13:47] <mbuf> ikshitij, this again comes down to individual / project members' taste
[13:47] <san-D_> 1. Learned how to interact with fellow developers and how to approach project maintainers, online communication etiquette , came to know about mailing lists. Learned how to use tools for development  like git, github, vim, emacs, markdown. Learned importance of licensing , documentation, readability. This training has taught how to make a proper projects.
[13:48] <deepika> How have you benefited from the summer training till date (or how different are you from the time you joined the training
[13:48] <deepika> i would have never imagined , i would be able to learn all the skills albeit at the beginner level (still learning though) without dgplug,
[13:48] <deepika> i got to learn about things that were alien to me in the past , like emacs, touch typing's utility , Free Software Movement, mailing lists , need of community , need of writing code in good format, license , and knowing that people are there to help and guide in journey , i suggest dgplug to every person whose's interested for a start in opensource without second thought ,and learnt a lot referring pym and lym ,
[13:48] <deepika> thanks for all the time and effort you put in us :)
[13:48] <ikshitij> mbuf: yes that depends on what project members and mentors taste
[13:48] <anuGupta> I ask people here and even then I feel I don't understand, then I switch to something else because sometimes it gets very difficult to me honestly.
[13:49] <mbuf> ikshitij, also, we don't want to end up like another code competition group; we like to give attention to people; that is what makes us different
[13:49] <mbuf> ikshitij, there are plenty of programming exercises like exercism.io, Project Euler that you can submit assignments and validate the answers
[13:50] <mbuf> ikshitij, the objective here is to guide along the way; we are not interested in the answers, but, the journey
[13:50] <schubisu> roll call: Robin Schubert, sorry ;) 1) I'm very happy I stumbled into this summertraining. I'm not new to programming in general, but what I was interested in was how to contribute to open source development to give something back. The direction this course took me had a great influence on my all-day life, I have a much better understanding/awareness of the FOSS world, hacker culture and freedom of
[13:50] <schubisu> software and internet now. I feel like I haven't learned that much interesting stuff for a long time.
[13:50] <knrai> 1. Before joining this training I had a quetion how to  start contribute to open source, what are the basics I should learn. now after joining this training I think i learned all those basics and now I can make my own projects and really happy about that
[13:50] <mbuf> anuGupta, you have to approach different leads to understand a concept - books, online articles, blogs, IRC, forums etc.
[13:51] <mbuf> anuGupta, for the same topic, different people will give a different perspective, and it will clarify your doubts very well; but, you should continue to pursue to understand
[13:51] <anuGupta> Yes, True.
[13:51] <mbuf> anuGupta, that is important; so, don't give up yet!
[13:51] <anuGupta> Yeah :)
[13:52] <mbuf> knrai, once you gain good project experience, you can start projects on your own; but, we would like you to also participate in existing F/OSS projects
[13:52] <ikshitij> mbuf: I meant using GNOME etherpad to submit task like sayan were using
[13:53] <anuGupta> mbuf, answered:)
[13:53] <schubisu> 2) What I noticed; the knowledge of the students was on very different levels at the start. Some never tried a linux distro in their life before. I think that I was able to focus on other things, because I knew the technical stuff already. Others may have had a disadvantage or not that much fun while learning much more. So maybe there should be two courses, to bring everyone on a base level first.
[13:53] <mbuf> ikshitij, I have not seen it, can you provide a link?
[13:54] <kushal> schubisu, Correct, but that means way too much pressure on people who are running the sessions. And as you can see, we don't have many regular volunteers.
[13:54] <ikshitij> https://etherpad.gnome.org/p/dgplug-2018
[13:54] <mbuf> schubisu, in any group of people, the experience will vary; we want everyone to be in the same room for the reason that we will learn from each other; this also falls inline with the PyCon Pune conference where there was a single hall
[13:55] <mbuf> schubisu, the idea is to bring the beginners to come to speed with the experienced; of course, for the experienced some may be like a refresher course
[13:56] <soumam007> mbuf after few days if we gather enough knowledge we will like to take that responsibility for the very beginners :)
[13:56] <mbuf> ikshitij, that is left to the individual, IMO
[13:57] <mbuf> soumam007, sure; the point is we teach what we know; what we don't know, we learn individually, or collectively as a group by sharing info
[13:57] <schubisu> kushal, mbuf: sure, I absolutely understand. But it was no refresher for me, there was still so much meta information to learn. It's just very much information and background (which is great) plus the technical stuff (which is crucial) so quite a lot ;)
[13:58] <mbuf> schubisu, some people use Etherpad for tasks, some might send you e-mail, others might use Scrum/Kanban boards, I use Org mode; so it depends on your mentor or the project and what tool they use
[13:58] <mbuf> s/schubisu/ikshitij/
[13:58] <mbuf> what do you think could have been done differently?
[13:59] <mbuf> anything that annoyed you, felt was not correct, or shouldn't be in the training?
[13:59] <ikshitij> mbuf: Nothing other than this
[14:00] <schubisu> mbuf: I think the agenda so far was great
[14:00] <schubisu> mbuf: as the way it was conducted
[14:00] <mbuf> ikshitij, schubisu okay
[14:00] <soumam007> never felt like that day except that day when the class was conducted even in the final match between ind vs pak
[14:00] <soumam007> thats a national holiday right? :P
[14:01] <ikshitij> soumam007: :P
[14:01] <mbuf> soumam007, honestly speaking, when I came to know betting was in place, I stopped watching cricket matches; unless, you want to watch it for pure *entertainment*
[14:01] <yurii> 2. For me It would be good to have more practical sessions how to use  some stuff - especially ssh, gpg, gitHub
[14:01] <mbuf> soumam007, might as well spend that time on something useful; but, that is a personal choice
[14:02] <soumam007> hahaa no no its ok :)
[14:02] <mbuf> yurii, so the class sessions are to get you started, and then you need to explore on the subject
[14:02] <mbuf> yurii, for example, reading more on SSH and how it works; or, how to optimize its speed; what configuration options exist
[14:03] <mbuf> yurii, look at blog posts on how people use SSH
[14:03] <yurii> mbuf - yes right.
[14:03] <mbuf> yurii, read the book "SSH: The Secure Shell" The Definite Guide, for example
[14:04] <mbuf> yurii, so, if that interests you, then you seek out for more information and learn on it; maybe, even look at pending tasks for the SSH project, or look at bugs to fix them
[14:04] <mbuf> yurii, so, you basically master the tool for your use
[14:04] <yurii> I mean after we start  we switch to enother topic next time and enother next time.
[14:05] <mbuf> yurii, that is correct; we address the breadth of topics, and not go in-depth; for this, you need to work in a project or find a mentor
[14:05] <yurii> but this is ok - we have a lot of sources
[14:05] <mbuf> yurii, this is more specialisation
[14:06] <mbuf> yurii, sure, if you need any specific information, you can ask; if we don't know, or if we know someone who might, we can refer you to the person or project
[14:07] <yurii> I belive that it is the long way to learn
[14:07] <mbuf> true; Now that the basics or foundation has been laid out to you, what do you want to do next?
[14:10] <anuGupta> What I want to do is to stay focused and never give up on things that I don't understand. Currently, I am thinking to create a project for me. I just need to engage time in doing, reading, writing and much more stuffs. I hope everything works fine. I wish not going to college anymore but they call our parents if our attendance is low, so sometimes it is too difficult to get time but always wanted to make it a habit of doing thin
[14:10] <mbuf> or, have you decided on a domain or project that interests you that you want to work with?
[14:10] <mbuf> anuGupta, did you read my IRC session on time management?
[14:11] <anuGupta> I wish to make a bot for myself :)
[14:11] <mbuf> anuGupta, what in its purpose?
[14:11] <mbuf> s/in/is/
[14:11] <anuGupta> Yes , I guess.
[14:11] <anuGupta> Purpose of what?
[14:11] <mbuf> anuGupta, the bot
[14:12] <mbuf> anuGupta, what do you intend to learn from making a bot for yourself?
[14:12] <mbuf> anuGupta, what are the objectives? what is the motivation?
[14:12] <anuGupta> Taking it as a project.
[14:12] <anuGupta> And using tools which I have learned so far.
[14:14] <mbuf> anuGupta, how is the bot going to be different from other bots? how is it going to differentiate itself? re-inventing the wheel is discouraged in F/OSS, unless you have a strong reason to do so
[14:15] <realslimshanky> anuGupta, it's better if you think of a problem which you want to solve before starting the project imho.
[14:15] <mbuf> anuGupta, working with existing bot projects, or extending it, can add value to the project and to yourself
[14:15] <mbuf> anuGupta, of course, that is a personal decision
[14:15] <realslimshanky> mbuf, I totally agree with you.
[14:16] <deepika> mbuf: at the beginning ,sayan shared dgplug school website ,iirc ,is it correct ?
[14:16] <anuGupta> Understood mbuf,realimshanky
[14:16] <anuGupta> *s/realimshanky/realslimshanky
[14:17] <mbuf> my suggestion is to have a list of mentors, and projects that they work, put up in the dgplug wiki, and you can contact them for project work;
[14:17] <realslimshanky> anuGupta, I've made few bots using python and have also given talk on it. If you want you can ping me for help.
[14:17] <mbuf> or, if you have identified your domain and project of interest, then you can approach the project for tasks
[14:17] <mbuf> deepika, dgplug school website?
[14:18] <mbuf> the project members will have their own tools, workflows that you need to adhere to, and hence, reading on the project wiki should help you to know more about it
[14:18] <mbuf> you can pick up small tasks, and submit patches or changes for review
[14:19] <anuGupta> realslimshanky, as sayan told of thinking of a problem before making a project, I gave it a thought and came up with an idea I have a problem for which I want the bot to be made.
[14:19] <mbuf> you can continue to learn from us in this channel, but, there is nothing like real world hands-on experience
[14:19] <mbuf> anuGupta, have you looked at existing bots to see if they solve the problem for you? you need to justify the same
[14:20] <anuGupta> Actually no :( will surely go through once the existing ones.
[14:20] <mbuf> if you have not decided on a project/domain, I'd suggest you think about what you want to work on, and then proceed with your decision
[14:22] <mbuf> we will continue to have our discussions, posts, guest sessions; and you should slowly but steadily transition to working in a project
[14:22] <realslimshanky> does irc has a central directory from where one can look at all the bots hosted in irc.
[14:22] <mbuf> work with a project for at least two years
[14:22] <realslimshanky> ?
[14:22] <bhavin192> mbuf, means it can be existing project of our interest or we will create something new which is related to that domain, right?
[14:22] <mbuf> only then you will get a good understanding of the same
[14:23] <mbuf> bhavin192, it can be either, but, if you are creating one from scratch, you need to decide how it is going to be a differentiator
[14:23] <ashwanig> 1. Yes, I think I have benefited from this summer training. I have learnt many new stuff during this trining which include vim, gnupg, git. I also learnt about the history of open source and free software for the first time. I think during this training till now, I have improved my reading habits and I have understood the importance of coding everyday.
[14:24] <mbuf> bhavin192, you always want to add value to yourself and the project
[14:24] <yurii> 3. I would like to be involved in  project
[14:24] <mbuf> bhavin192, it should always be an addendum; sure, there can be two versions of chocolate ice-creams, but, then there is competition :)
[14:25] <mbuf> yurii, have you decided on your domain of interest or a project that you want to work on?
[14:25] <yurii> Not sure yet
[14:25] <mbuf> yurii, find your interest first; and then look at existing F/OSS projects
[14:25] <bhavin192> mbuf, understood!
[14:26] <yurii> where can I have a look for existing projects
[14:26] <mbuf> yurii, your interest should be something that you want to work on, even if the odds are against you; something that you want to work late at night, without sleep;
[14:26] <mbuf> yurii, something on which you will never give up; something that is your passion
[14:27] <ashwanig> 2. Not sure 3. Next, I want to contribute to a open source project. But I am not sure how I should decide one.
[14:27] <mbuf> yurii, openhatch.org is one such site
[14:27] <soumam007> mbuf at present level i cant think of a project which i have to give two years; what we term as a project may be some webapp; something like an extension which will search the internet to give us the movies/music/books at one search
[14:27] <mbuf> ashwanig, 3. comes down to choosing your ice-cream
[14:27] <mbuf> soumam007, who is going to use it?
[14:27] <yurii> ok
[14:28] <mbuf> soumam007, think about the users who are going to consume the software as well
[14:28] <mbuf> *favourite ice-cream
[14:29] <mbuf> yurii, you can also search for projects in GitHub or GitLab for repositories; most of them have a TODO or HACKING file in it
[14:29] <mbuf> yurii, the GSoC list of projects has a good number as well
[14:29] <soumam007> ok you mbuf thats a good aspect but till now i havent develop such skills to help others problem; for that i need to talk with other people understand their problems
[14:29] <soumam007> s/you/yes
[14:29] <mbuf> soumam007, it can also be a software that you use daily and you want to improve
[14:30] <mbuf> soumam007, the important point is you should use the software/hardware first, before you can contribute to it
[14:30] <mbuf> soumam007, if you do not know how to use the software, you will not be able to test it
[14:30] <mbuf> soumam007, again, the problem that you want to solve should interest you
[14:31] <ashwanig> mbuf, I know, but most of them have that huge code base which I feel difficult to understand. And sometimes there is a language requirement which I don't know and so I have to learn that language first to understand the code
[14:31] <soumam007> yes like someone did youtube downloader for a full playlist thats a good one; and i am interested to contribute to that
[14:31] <mbuf> soumam007, it should be something that you want to stay awake to solve it; that should be the challenge that you want to work with
[14:31] <ashwanig> Then I get stuck at that point
[14:31] <soumam007> yeah mbuf :)
[14:31] <mbuf> ashwanig, break the tasks into sub-tasks, and attack each one
[14:32] <mbuf> ashwanig, remember the "Divide and Conquer" algorithm; what you have been through in the last couple of months is the result of that
[14:32] <mbuf> ashwanig, we have actually broken down a complex learning curve into small steps, and you were all able to follow it
[14:32] <mbuf> ashwanig, the principle remains the same; yes, you have to learn the languag, yes, you have to understand the code
[14:33] <mbuf> ashwanig, projects will have beginner tasks which you can pick; bug fixing is a good way to get started with large code bases, because, you will walk through the code and analyse it
[14:34] <mbuf> ashwanig, the methodology is what we have taught you, and you need to apply that in practice
[14:34] <ashwanig> mbuf, How should I ask for help from the people who are involved in the project? I mean if I have no idea about what is doing what?
[14:34] <mbuf> ashwanig, if you get stuck, it is good to reach out and ask for help
[14:35] <mbuf> ashwanig, find a project member or mentor
[14:35] <mbuf> ashwanig, write to the mailing list, ask on IRC
[14:35] <mbuf> ashwanig, you now know how to do all of this
[14:35] <mbuf> ashwanig, by you, I don't mean "you", but, all the participants in the training
[14:36] <mbuf> ashwanig, the thought process and what homework you did to analyse the stuck problem is also important
[14:36] <mbuf> anyways, thanks for all your feedback
[14:37] <mbuf> We will continue to learn, and have retrospection sessions in future on how each one is doing in future
[14:37] <soumam007> Thanks for the initiative :)
[14:37] <mbuf> kushal, do want to add anything?
[14:37] <ashwanig> mbuf, Thanks :)
[14:37] <mbuf> think of this session as a pit stop
[14:38] <deepika> 2: mbuf: for the beginners if some reading material be referred prior to session that may bring lesser difference between beginners and intermediates
[14:38] <deepika> 3: Not sure , but thinking of mozilla for bug fix , tried to find a bug but didn't understand it well ,
[14:38] <mbuf> you need to re-fuel and re-juvenate
[14:39] <mbuf> deepika, sure; that depends on the person taking the session; but, pre-requisites can be mentioned, yes
[14:39] <mbuf> deepika, we don't want to announce sessions because, we want people to hangout in the channel, make friends, and learn
[14:39] <mbuf> deepika, we don't want to be very formal though
[14:40] <mbuf> deepika, the first step is to replicate the bug at your end
[14:40] <mbuf> deepika, it is called "triaging"; read on that
[14:40] <mbuf> deepika, you might also want to find someone in Mozilla who understands the code base, to see the thought process
[14:41] <mbuf> deepika, see the test documentation for the project, and see how to run the tests, and why the tests didn't catch the bug, if you have been able to replicate it
[14:41] <mbuf> deepika, all this, you have to document, maybe write a blog post, or send it as a comment in the bug, or to the project mailing list
[14:41] <mbuf> deepika, but, I guess, you get the idea
[14:42] <mbuf> deepika, you probably need to contact a Mozilla Rep, maybe?
[14:43] <mbuf> any other feedback that people want to give before I end the class
[14:44] <deepika> mbuf: sure , i'll read about triaging , okay  , thanks mbuf :)
[14:44] <mbuf> deepika, one step at a time
[14:44] <mbuf> deepika, write down the task, then break it down into sub-tasks, and work your way through each sub-task, documenting each and every step
[14:44] <mbuf> roll call please

[13:28] <mbuf> Welcome to today's session on "Introduction to Emacs Lisp"
[13:28] <bhavin192> Bhavin Gandhi
[13:28] <mbuf> If you already have GNU Emacs, or any other variant (Aquaemacs, Spacemacs, XEmacs, etc.) installed, you can proceed to try out the simple code snippets I am going to discuss with you today. Otherwise, you can always try them out after the session
[13:29] <mbuf> You do not need to know Emacs Lisp to use the GNU Emacs editor.
[13:29] <mbuf> But, if that is the editor that you plan to use for your day-to-day activities, you will want to customize it and extend it to your needs
[13:30] <mbuf> You can copy code snippets from others' Emacs configuration files and use it, and you should still be fine
[13:30] <mbuf> But, learning to extend it will be extremely helpful as it can be tailored to your needs
[13:30] <mbuf> You can get readymade garments in a shopping mall, but, the one that is customized to you, and that fits you well will help you in the long run
[13:31] <mbuf> Hence, it is good to know Emacs Lisp
[13:31] <mbuf> You can open the editor now and type these code snippets in the scratch buffer itself
[13:31] <ashwanig[m]> Roll call: Ashwani Kumar Gupta
[13:31] <mbuf> If you type C-x C-e at the end of each code snippet (called as s-expressions), the result will be shown in the minibuffer
[13:32] <mbuf> At the end of the session, I will tell you references where you can learn more about Emacs LIsp
[13:32] <mbuf> *Lisp
[13:32] <schubisu> !
[13:32] <mbuf> I hope this session gets you started with the basic syntax and usage, and helps you work and extend the editor to your needs, and improves your productivity
[13:32] <mbuf> next
[13:33] <schubisu> mbuf: do I need a special main mode for scratch buffer to evaluate lisp?
[13:33] <mbuf> schubisu, you can turn on Emacs-Lisp mode
[13:33] <schubisu> s/main/major/
[13:34] <mbuf> schubisu, M-x emacs-lisp-mode
[13:34] <schubisu> mbuf: okay done, thank you
[13:34] <mbuf> schubisu, C is the Control key and M is the Alt key
[13:34] <mbuf> sorry, that is for everyone who is new to Emacs
[13:34] <mbuf> I also use Paredit which handles the parenthesis nicely; but, that can be done as a separate session
[13:35] <mbuf> or, you can refer lot of tutorials and blog posts on how to use it
[13:35] <mbuf> so, let's get started! Emacs Lisp is like any other Lisp variant
[13:35] <mbuf> It support basic atoms
[13:35] <mbuf> The following is an integer
[13:35] <mbuf> 42
[13:36] <mbuf> If you type 42 in the scratch buffer, and hit C-x C-e after the '2', Emacs will show 42 in the minibuffer
[13:37] <mbuf> Emacs is running a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL). So, any s-expression (symbolic expression) that you type will be evaluated by the interpreter, and the result will be shown in the minibuffer
[13:37] <mbuf> ELisp also has floats. So, the following is a floating point number
[13:37] <mbuf> 3.0
[13:38] <mbuf> I am typing all the s-expressions in a separate line so that when you review the log, you can just copy the code in Emacs and test the same
[13:38] <mbuf> The above number will evaluate to 3.0
[13:38] <pr97> roll call:
[13:38] <mbuf> Strings in Emacs Lisp are enclosed within double quotes. For example:
[13:38] <mbuf> "Hello, World"
[13:38] <pr97> roll call: Priyanka Sharma
[13:39] <mbuf> The Lisp language is very simple, and hence it is easy for anyone to pick it up
[13:40] <mbuf> The syntax is simple and allows you to extend it as well. These are the basic atoms. Everything else is a symbolic expression represented within parenthesis
[13:40] <mbuf> (+ 1 2 3)
[13:40] <mbuf> In the above s-expression, + is a function and it takes three arguments 1, 2 and 3
[13:41] <mbuf> If you evaluate the expression in the *Scratch* buffer, you will get the result 6
[13:41] <mbuf> The arguments to the function can also be s-expressions
[13:41] <mbuf> (+ (* 2 3) (/ 8 4))
[13:42] <mbuf> In the above example, the + function has two arguments. Both the arguments are evaluated (inside the REPL) first, and the result is given to the + function
[13:43] <mbuf> So, the above expression transforms to (+ 6 2), which results in 8 if you evaluate the same in the *Scratch* buffer using C-x C-e
[13:43] <mbuf> The idea of using such s-expressions is that you can build code incrementally, test them individually and validate them
[13:44] <mbuf> writing such code is a pleasure and gives you confidence as well
[13:44] <mbuf> you can also write small functions and build larger projects using them
[13:44] <mbuf> it is readable, maintainable too
[13:45] <mbuf> The following is a list in Emacs Lisp
[13:45] <mbuf> (1 2 3)
[13:45] <mbuf> If you try to evaluate the above in the *Scratch* buffer, you will get an error
[13:45] <mbuf> Debugger entered--Lisp error: (invalid-function 1)
[13:46] <mbuf> Emacs Lisp thinks that 1 is a function and 2, 3 are arguments to it
[13:46] <mbuf> In order to treat this as a list, and not let the REPL evaluate it, you need to quote it as follows:
[13:46] <mbuf> (quote (1 2 3))
[13:46] <mbuf> If you now evaluate the above expression (C-x C-e), it will return the list (1 2 3)
[13:47] <mbuf> Here after when I say evaluate the expression, you should understand that you will type the expression in the *Scratch* buffer, go to the end of the expression and type C-x C-e
[13:47] <soumam007> !
[13:47] <mbuf> To avoid writing 'quote' in the code, you can also its symbol as follows
[13:47] <mbuf> '(1 2 3)
[13:48] <mbuf> The above will also evaluate to the list (1 2 3)
[13:48] <mbuf> next
[13:48] <mbuf> You can also use the "list" keyword to create a list
[13:48] <soumam007> mbuf i am understanding what you are saying but cant execute
[13:48] <mbuf> (list 1 2 3)
[13:48] <mbuf> soumam007, do you have a *Scratch* buffer in Emacs?
[13:48] <soumam007> its written emacs-lisp
[13:49] <mbuf> soumam007, did you type the s-expression (list 1 2 3) in the buffer?
[13:49] <schubisu> soumam007: I use , e l to execute
[13:49] <mbuf> soumam007, move your cursor after the closing parenthesis
[13:49] <schubisu> soumam007: in spacemacs
[13:49] <mbuf> soumam007, no spacemacs here, sorry; schubisu thanks!
[13:49] <soumam007> ok
[13:50] <soumam007> :(
[13:50] <mbuf> You can also have nested lists
[13:50] <mbuf> '(1 2 (3 4 5) (6 (7)))
[13:50] <mbuf> Lisp is list processing. So, everything is just a list. You have basic atoms, and s-expressions.
[13:51] <mbuf> Sometimes people jokingly call it Lot of Irritating Silly Parenthesis
[13:51] <mbuf> or Lost in Stupid Parentheses
[13:51] <mbuf> If you use Paredit mode, it will manage the parenthesis for you
[13:52] <mbuf> The following is a list:
[13:52] <mbuf> '(+ 1 2 3)
[13:52] <mbuf> Even though you have a + function, since you have quoted the expression, the REPL will not evaluate it
[13:52] <mbuf> Think of quoting similar to use of backslash in the Bash prompt when you want to escape characters
[13:53] <mbuf> If you want to get the first element or head of the list, use car:
[13:53] <mbuf> (car '(1 2 3))
[13:53] <mbuf> Historically, car stands for Content of Address Register
[13:54] <mbuf> The above expression will return 1
[13:54] <mbuf> If you want the tail of the list, use CDR:
[13:54] <mbuf> (cdr '(1 2 3))
[13:54] <mbuf> CDR stands for Contents of Decrement Register. The terminology was used in IBM 704 architecture and it continues to remain
[13:55] <mbuf> so Lisp is old, but, has stood the test of time!
[13:55] <mbuf> The following evaluates to nil:
[13:56] <mbuf> '()
[13:56] <mbuf> ()
[13:56] <mbuf> False is represented as nil in Emacs Lisp
[13:56] <mbuf> Everything else is a truthy value
[13:57] <mbuf> BTW, Emacs Lisp is a strongly typed, dynamic programming language
[13:57] <mbuf> By strongly typed, it will check for run-time errors. Since, you are writing code on the fly, and evaluating it in the REPL it is dynamically typed
[13:57] <mbuf> You can also byte-compile the ELisp files for speed
[13:58] <mbuf> (cdr '(42))
[13:58] <mbuf> The above expression returns nil
[13:58] <mbuf> Think of a list created with a nil (or NULL pointer) at the end
[13:59] <mbuf> So, '(42) has 42 and nil, and when you want the tail of the list, it returns nil
[13:59] <mbuf> (null nil)
[13:59] <mbuf> null is a pre-defined function that tells you if its argument is nil
[14:00] <mbuf> The above returns 't' for true
[14:00] <mbuf> (null '())
[14:00] <mbuf> So, does the above expression too
[14:00] <mbuf> You can construct lists using the 'cons' keyword too:
[14:00] <mbuf> (cons 1 '())
[14:00] <mbuf> The above should yield (1)
[14:01] <mbuf> Of course, you can add an element to an existing list as follows:
[14:01] <mbuf> (cons 1 '(2 3))
[14:01] <mbuf> This will return the list (1 2 3)
[14:01] <mbuf> The above can also be written as:
[14:01] <mbuf> (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '())))
[14:02] <mbuf> The append function can append a list to another, as in the following example:
[14:02] <mbuf> (append '(1 2) '(3 4))
[14:02] <mbuf> The result will be (1 2 3 4)
[14:03] <mbuf> The Emacs Reference manual has a comprehensive list of functions that you can refer
[14:04] <mbuf> Emacs Lisp has some features from Common Lisp
[14:04] <schubisu> !
[14:04] <mbuf> The CL standard is huge compared to Scheme. Scheme standard is small and simple
[14:04] <mbuf> next
[14:05] <schubisu> mbuf: I don't know what the cons function does, what am I doing with (cons 1 2)?
[14:05] <schubisu> the result is 1 . 2
[14:05] <mbuf> schubisu, you are creating a list with elements 1 and 2
[14:05] <mbuf> schubisu, that is the dot notation that is used is spacemacs
[14:06] <jasonbraganza> cons for construct?
[14:06] <mbuf> schubisu, rather, constructing the list
[14:06] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, yes
[14:06] <schubisu> mbuf: but it's different when I use (list 1 2)
[14:06] <schubisu> mbuf: and I cannot give more than 2 arguments to cons, what is the major difference to list?
[14:07] <mbuf> schubisu, The result of cons is a pair
[14:08] <mbuf> schubisu, the dot representation is used if the second argument is not empty
[14:08] <mbuf> schubisu, list is used to create a list
[14:08] <mbuf> schubisu, http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dotted-Pair-Notation.html
[14:09] <schubisu> mbuf: ah, I see the hint cons (CAR CDR), okay
[14:09] <schubisu> thanks mbuf
[14:09] <mbuf> Okay
[14:09] <mbuf> If you now evaluate the following in the buffer
[14:09] <mbuf> some-foo-list
[14:10] <mbuf> You will get an error (void-variable some-foo-list)
[14:10] <mbuf> This is because in your REPL session, some-foo-list is not defined!
[14:10] <mbuf> So, you can assign a value to the variable using the set function
[14:10] <mbuf> (set 'some-list '(1 2 3))
[14:11] <mbuf> If you know evaluate some-list in the buffer, it will return the result (1 2 3)
[14:11] <mbuf> The set and ' in the expression is common, that, there is a simpler syntax for it
[14:12] <mbuf> (setq some-list '(1 2 3))
[14:12] <mbuf> Both, evaluate to the same result
[14:12] <jasonbraganza> and now some-list gives me (1 2 3)
[14:14] <mbuf> Note here that setq is not a function, it is a macro (will talk about this at the end)
[14:14] <mbuf> But the concept is the same
[14:14] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, right!
[14:15] <mbuf> You can scope the variable assignment using ... parenthesis of course
[14:15] <mbuf> (let ((a 1)
[14:15] <mbuf>       (b 5))
[14:15] <mbuf>   (+ a b))
[14:16] <mbuf> The let allows you to set local variables
[14:16] <mbuf> Inside let, you have two assignments for a and b
[14:16] <mbuf> which are then used to evaluate (+ a b)
[14:17] <mbuf> If you evaluate the above expression, you will get the result 6
[14:17] <mbuf> Of course, if you just type the letter a in the buffer and try to evaluate it, you should get an error
[14:17] <mbuf> (void-variable a)
[14:17] <mbuf> Because the scope of a is inside the (let (...) (+ a b)) expression
[14:18] <mbuf> If you have multiple variable assignments that depend on the previous assignment, you can use let*
[14:18] <mbuf> (let* ((a 3)
[14:18] <mbuf>        (b (+ a 5)))
[14:18] <mbuf>   (+ a b))
[14:18] <mbuf> In the above example, a is 3, then b is assigned 8, and the result of the expression is 11
[14:19] <mbuf> So far, we have seen basic atoms, lists and using some pre-defined functions
[14:19] <mbuf> We can now create our own functions using the defun keyword
[14:19] <mbuf> (defun say-hello ()
[14:19] <mbuf>   "Hello, World!")
[14:20] <mbuf> Of course, everything inside parenthesis :)
[14:20] <mbuf> You use the defun keyword followed by the function-name, parenthesis and the body of the function
[14:20] <mbuf> The value of the last s-expression is returned as the result
[14:21] <mbuf> You first have to evaluate the above function definition so that it is loaded into the REPL
[14:21] <mbuf> Go to the end of "Hello, World!") <- keep cursor here, and press C-x C-e
[14:22] <jasonbraganza> say-hello
[14:22] <mbuf> In the minibuffer, you will see the message say-hello
[14:22] <mbuf> So, the function is now available in the REPL. In order to call it, or apply it, you have to use:
[14:22] <mbuf> (say-hello)
[14:22] <mbuf> You will see the "Hello, World!" message printed in the minibuffer
[14:22] <jasonbraganza> yes!
[14:23] <mbuf> say-hello is just like + or any other function
[14:23] <mbuf> Let us define a function that takes an argument
[14:23] <mbuf> (defun square (x)
[14:23] <mbuf>   (* x x))
[14:23] <mbuf> Again, you have C-x C-e at the end of the function to evaluate it
[14:23] <mbuf> You can now, apply the function using:
[14:23] <mbuf> (square 2)
[14:23] <mbuf> And you will get the result 4
[14:24] <mbuf> But, what happens if you pass a string to the function?
[14:24] <mbuf> (square "Weird!")
[14:24] <mbuf> You get a run-time error, (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p "Weird!")
[14:24] <jasonbraganza> with two weirds! :)
[14:25] <mbuf> The number 0 evaluates to 0
[14:25] <mbuf> "" evaluates to ""
[14:25] <mbuf> t evaluates to t
[14:25] <mbuf> All these are truthy values
[14:25] <jasonbraganza> t for true?
[14:26] <mbuf> Only the following evaluate to false or nill
[14:26] <mbuf> nil
[14:26] <mbuf> ()
[14:26] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, yes
[14:26] <mbuf> You can have boolean expressions such as the following:
[14:26] <mbuf> (and t "" 0 7)
[14:26] <mbuf> Since, all of them are truthy values, the result will be true. But, which value should and return?
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> 7
[14:27] <mbuf> It will return the last truthy value which is 7
[14:27] <mbuf> (or nil "foo" '() "bar")
[14:27] <mbuf> In the above 'or' example, the expression evaluates to true, but, which truthy value should it return?
[14:27] <mbuf> It will return the first truthy value
[14:27] <jasonbraganza> first?
[14:27] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, yes
[14:27] <mbuf> (not nil)
[14:27] <mbuf> The above expression evaluates to true
[14:28] <mbuf> Let us now look at some conditional expressions
[14:28] <mbuf> The following is a when example:
[14:28] <mbuf> (when (= (+ 2 2) 4)
[14:28] <mbuf>   "Passed sanity check!")
[14:28] <mbuf> When the condition is true, evaluate its body
[14:29] <mbuf> The if statement has a condition, s-expression for success immediately following the if condition, and then the else statement
[14:29] <mbuf> (defun evens-or-odds (n)
[14:29] <mbuf>   (if (= 0 (% n 2))
[14:29] <mbuf>       "Even!"
[14:29] <mbuf>     "Odd!"))
[14:30] <mbuf> Of course, first load the function to the REPL by using C-x C-e
[14:30] <mbuf> You can then test it with the following:
[14:30] <mbuf> (evens-or-odds 4)
[14:30] <mbuf> (evens-or-odds 3)
[14:30] <mbuf> The output will be "Even!" and "Odd!" respectively
[14:31] <mbuf> Similar to a multips switch case statement, you can use the *cond* keyword
[14:31] <mbuf> (defun pick-a-word (n)
[14:31] <mbuf>   (cond
[14:31] <mbuf>    ((= n 1) "One")
[14:31] <mbuf>    ((= n 2) "Two")
[14:31] <mbuf>    ((= n 3) "Three")
[14:31] <mbuf>    (t "42")))
[14:32] <mbuf> After each cond is an s-expression, and each is tested in order
[14:32] <mbuf> (pick-a-word 2)
[14:32] <mbuf> The above will return "Two"
[14:32] <mbuf> (pick-a-word 100)
[14:32] <mbuf> Gives the universal answer 42
[14:33] <mbuf> That is all there is to the language; the rest are all concepts
[14:33] <mbuf> I can define a recursive function, factorial, for example as follows:
[14:33] <mbuf> (defun factorial (n)
[14:33] <mbuf>   (if (< n 1)
[14:33] <mbuf>       1
[14:33] <mbuf>     (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
[14:33] <schubisu> !
[14:33] <mbuf> next
[14:33] <schubisu> how would I loop over a list?
[14:34] <mbuf> schubisu, in general no
[14:35] <mbuf> schubisu, recursion is one way to operate on lists, or use map functions
[14:35] <mbuf> schubisu, recursion is based on mathematical induction and hence is proven
[14:36] <mbuf> schubisu, you have a base case or the terminating case, and then you have the induction step
[14:36] <mbuf> schubisu, Lisp is based on lambda calculus, and hence recursion is heavily used
[14:36] <mbuf> (factorial 5)
[14:36] <mbuf> will yield 120
[14:37] <jasonbraganza> mbuf - i get 120 (#o170, #x78, ?x)
[14:37] <jasonbraganza> what are those squiggly characters?
[14:37] <jasonbraganza> i am doing something wrong?
[14:37] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, octal and hexadecimal values of 120
[14:38] <jasonbraganza> dammit! XD
[14:38] <jasonbraganza> bhavin192 - thank you
[14:38] <mbuf> schubisu, some CL implement tail call optimization https://0branch.com/notes/tco-cl.html
[14:38] <bhavin192> jasonbraganza, but don't know about last one
[14:39] <mbuf> BTW, reddit has popular discussions on emacs https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2s9wxw/why_doesnt_emacs_lisp_have_optimized_tail/
[14:39] <mbuf> Let us continue, few more sections left
[14:39] <mbuf> Sometimes, you do not want to name a function, and just want to use it in a body of a function
[14:39] <mbuf> So, you can use anonymous functions for the same
[14:39] <mbuf> (lambda (x) (* x x x))
[14:40] <mbuf> The above is a definition of a function that takes one argument and cubes it
[14:41] <mbuf> Emacs has a pretty-symbols-mode where lambda can be replaced with Î»
[14:41] <mbuf> Your code is pretty
[14:42] <mbuf> How can we evaluate or apply the above function? You need to pass an argument to it. The basic form is (function argument)
[14:42] <mbuf> ((lambda (x) (* x x x)) 5)
[14:42] <mbuf> So, the above s-expression passes 5 as an argument to the function and returns 125
[14:42] <mbuf> You can also call a function using funcall
[14:43] <mbuf> (funcall '+ 1 2)
[14:43] <mbuf> The above evaluates to 3
[14:43] <mbuf> If you were to apply the funcall to our lambda function, it will be:
[14:43] <mbuf> (funcall (lambda (x) (* x x x)) 5)
[14:43] <mbuf> The result is the same!
[14:44] <mbuf> You can also use the fset keyword to assign a lambda function to a name
[14:44] <mbuf> (fset 'cube (lambda (x) (* x x x)))
[14:44] <mbuf> (cube 4)
[14:44] <mbuf> Evaluating both of the above expressions should give you 64
[14:44] <mbuf> Everything here in Lisp is just atoms and s-expressions (data and code)
[14:45] <mbuf> The code has data too, and hence everything is just data!
[14:45] <mbuf> You can pass functions as arguments. Such functions are called as higher-order functions
[14:45] <mbuf> (defun transform-unless-zero (fn n)
[14:45] <mbuf>   (if (= n 0)
[14:45] <mbuf>       0
[14:45] <mbuf>     (funcall fn n)))
[14:46] <mbuf> You pass a function and argument to transform-unless-zero. If the number is zero, you return zero
[14:46] <mbuf> Otherwise, you call the passed function argument with n
[14:46] <mbuf> (transform-unless-zero (lambda (n) (+ 1 n)) 0)
[14:46] <mbuf> The above gives 0
[14:46] <mbuf> (transform-unless-zero (lambda (n) (+ 1 n)) 7)
[14:46] <mbuf> The above yields 8
[14:47] <mbuf> Here is an example of operating on lists
[14:47] <mbuf> (mapcar (lambda (n) (+ 1 n)) '(1 2 3 4))
[14:47] <mbuf> The idea of using functions like filter, map, reductions is that you can parallelize the operations on multi-core systems
[14:47] <mbuf> If you byte-compile Lisp code, it is fast!
[14:48] <jasonbraganza> !
[14:48] <mbuf> next
[14:48] <jasonbraganza> what did we just do if not loop over the list?
[14:48] <jasonbraganza> <eom>
[14:48] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, it is not looping in the tradition sense because you can parallelize the above operation
[14:49] <jasonbraganza> aaaah. got you. thank you.
[14:49] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, in the conventional for loop, you iterate each time; see mapping over sequences https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/Mapping-over-Sequences.html
[14:50] <mbuf> So, you are incrementing the value in each list by 1 in the above mapcar function
[14:50] <mbuf> Consider the following sequence of s-expressions:
[14:50] <mbuf> (setq our-list '(1 2 3 4))
[14:50] <mbuf> (mapcar (lambda (n) (+ 1 n)) '(1 2 3 4))
[14:50] <mbuf> our-list
[14:50] <mbuf> You are assinging a list to our-list
[14:50] <mbuf> You are then incrementing each value in the list
[14:51] <jasonbraganza> yes
[14:51] <mbuf> If you evaluate each one, and finally check the value of our-list it will be (1 2 3 4)
[14:51] <jasonbraganza> yes, was going to ask that
[14:51] <mbuf> Even if you tried the following:
[14:51] <mbuf> (setq our-list '(1 2 3 4))
[14:51] <mbuf> (mapcar (lambda (n) (+ 1 n)) our-list)
[14:51] <mbuf> our-list
[14:52] <jasonbraganza> so i need to store my results intentionally
[14:52] <mbuf> The mapcar returns only a new list. It does not modify our-list!
[14:52] <mbuf> You can write programs in CL where you modify data in a function. In general, it is good to write immutable functions
[14:52] <mbuf> Because, you then get referential transparency - whatever input you give, the output will be the same
[14:53] <mbuf> So, you can separate pure code with I/O code
[14:53] <mbuf> It is also easy to read and maintain such code. Keep side-effect (IO, network, database, etc.) separate.
[14:54] <mbuf> *code separate
[14:54] <mbuf> (mapcar 'upcase '("a" "b" "c"))
[14:54] <mbuf> The above returns the list ("A" "B" "C")
[14:54] <mbuf> You are calling the 'upcase function on each element in the list
[14:55] <mbuf> You are encouraged to refer the Emacs Lisp reference manual to learn more on available functions
[14:55] <mbuf> You should be able to refer that inside Emacs itself
[14:55] <mbuf> The last section is macros
[14:55] <mbuf> We went through the REPL section where the code is read, evaluated, result is printed and the REPL loops back and waits for more input
[14:56] <mbuf> So, before evaluating, you can write macros that will emit Lisp code and do transformations before it is given to the REPL
[14:56] <mbuf> For example:
[14:56] <mbuf> (defmacro inc (var)
[14:56] <mbuf>   (list 'setq var (list '1+ var)))
[14:56] <mbuf> Using the defmacro keyword you are defining inc which takes an argument
[14:57] <mbuf> Suppose I have:
[14:57] <mbuf> (setq x 5)
[14:57] <mbuf> (inc x)
[14:57] <mbuf> I am assigning x to 5, and then calling (inc x)
[14:57] <mbuf> inc is a macro, and x is now var
[14:57] <mbuf> So, the macro will expand to:
[14:58] <mbuf> a list that contains setq x and a list where x is incremented by 1
[14:58] <mbuf> (setq x (1+ x))
[14:58] <mbuf> This code is generated by the macro and then fed to the REPL, and x now becomes 6
[14:58] <mbuf> So, you can write Lisp code (macros) to generate more Lisp code
[14:59] <jasonbraganza> trippy!
[14:59] <mbuf> This is a powerful feature of Lisp dialects
[14:59] <mbuf> Of course, if you can use a function, use a function. Keep macros to a minimum.
[14:59] <mbuf> This ends the basic introduction to Emacs Lisp.
[15:00] <mbuf> This is based on the NYC Emacs meetup presentation done by Harry Schwartz https://harryrschwartz.com/2014/04/08/an-introduction-to-emacs-lisp.html
[15:00] <schubisu> !
[15:00] <mbuf> You can watch the video, and also the PDF for reference
[15:00] <mbuf> next
[15:00] <schubisu> mbuf: why do we have to quote the '1? I'm not understanding that macro right now
[15:00] <mbuf> Whether you customize your Emacs, or write more ELisp code, I hope you find this useful
[15:01] <mbuf> schubisu, because you want the 1+ to be available in the output of the macro expansion as is
[15:01] <mbuf> schubisu, it should not be evaluated when the macro expands
[15:02] <mbuf> The PDF of Harry's article https://harryrschwartz.com/assets/documents/articles/an-introduction-to-emacs-lisp.pdf
[15:02] <mbuf> The following is a nice illustration or paredit-mode http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html
[15:03] <schubisu> mbuf: thanks, that was indeed helpful already. lisp code is still hard to read and not yet intuitive for me, requires a lot of experience I guess. Are there any formatting conventions? It becomes quite messy very quickly ;)
[15:04] <mbuf> schubisu, use Emacs-Lisp and Paredit mode, and you should be fine
[15:04] <mbuf> If you want to learn more, you can read this freely available book https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html
[15:05] <mbuf> "An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp" by Robert J. Chassell https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/pdf/eintr.pdf
[15:05] <mbuf> schubisu, start with Emacs customizations
[15:06] <mbuf> schubisu, and slowly you will be able to grasp how it works
[15:06] <mbuf> schubisu, because our minds are already stuffed with imperative, OOPS style, we have to unlearn to think functionally
[15:06] <mbuf> schubisu, but, people who start programming actually find thinking and writing functionally quite easy
[15:07] <mbuf> schubisu, you have to just break a large Lisp function to pieces, and understand each segment
[15:07] <mbuf> The Writing GNU Emacs Extensions book is also useful, http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565922617.do
[15:08] <mbuf> You can also join #emacs IRC channel for help and questions
[15:08] <mbuf> The help-gnu-emacs mailing list is also active
[15:08] <schubisu> mbuf: true, I was raised as on OOP ;) can you still explain the (list '1+ var) part of your macro? Is + a function here?
[15:08] <schubisu> or maybe you can give the steps to what this will evaluate?
[15:08] <mbuf> schubisu, let us break this down so it is easy for you to understand
[15:08] <mbuf> schubisu, exactly!
[15:09] <mbuf> schubisu, what does (1+ 2) evaluate to?
[15:09] <schubisu> mbuf: 3. Okay, I didn't expect that
[15:09] <mbuf> The s-expression evaluation happens like this, Read Lisp code, evaluate, print and wait again for more Lisp code
[15:10] <mbuf> schubisu, 1+ is a function
[15:10] <schubisu> ah, okay
[15:10] <schubisu> that was my missing piece to the puzzle ;)
[15:10] <mbuf> schubisu, when you have a macro, the steps are like, Read Lisp code, expand macro code, evaluate, print and wait again for more Lisp code
[15:10] <mbuf> schubisu, so the macro should write Lisp code, not evaluate the 1+
[15:11] <mbuf> schubisu, hence we escape it or backquote it or call it whatever you want in this case so that it does not evaluate it
[15:11] <mbuf> schubisu, so the macro step will write the Lisp code (setq x (1+ x))
[15:11] <mbuf> schubisu, during evaluation, 5 is passed as x, and the expression is evaluated and 6 is printed
[15:12] <mbuf> So, dynamically you can generate Lisp code on the fly using macros
[15:12] <mbuf> I hope this was useful. Please revise this content, and practice the code snippets
[15:12] <mbuf> Feel free to ask here if you need any help
[15:12] <schubisu> mbuf: okay I get it. What about evaluating a list with lisp code manually outside a macro?
[15:12] <jasonbraganza> this is the closest to natural language Iâve seen
[15:13] <mbuf> jasonbraganza, exactly!
[15:13] <schubisu> you're kidding XD
[15:13] <mbuf> schubisu, same with parenthesis
[15:13] <schubisu> It reminds me of Turing machines
[15:13] <mbuf> schubisu, (function arguments)
[15:13] <samridhia> i got confused with parenthesis!
[15:13] <yurii> mbuf , thank you for session
[15:14] <jasonbraganza> schubisu - lexically :) I got words. I can use them to write Ulysses or short poems or whatevere I choose
[15:14] <mbuf> schubisu, Common Lisp is Turing Complete
[15:15] <mbuf> samridhia, please review the session, go through Harry's notes for reference, or even watch the video
[15:15] <yurii> !
[15:15] <schubisu> jasonbraganza: I get what you mean, you can build up on very few basics
[15:15] <mbuf> My suggestion is to start with customization, and then you can build on top of that
[15:15] <mbuf> next
[15:15] <yurii> how can I invoke *scrath* buffwr in emacs
[15:15] <mbuf> yurii, are you using GNU Emacs?
[15:16] <yurii> *buffer*
[15:16] <mbuf> yurii, it is the default buffer you get when you open GNU Emacs
[15:16] <samridhia> mbuf, yup i will i liked it though, It is simple language except the parenthesis part which i will practice.
[15:18] <mbuf> samridhia, use different modes with parenthesis and you should be fine! Watch this video with John Wiegley https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRBcm6jFJ3Q&t=1s
[15:18] <mbuf> samridhia, (~ 1h) on Emacs Lisp development tips. You will find more online
[15:18] <samridhia> mbuf, ok thanks!

[14:13] <kvy_> kushal:  In Keyword only argument topic we have use * so it force us to  write right keyword of make our argument keyword.
[14:13] <kvy_> but what if we want to do that some of our argument become keyword and some remain variable.
[14:13] <kvy_> <eof>
[14:13] <kushal> kvy_, write a function like https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#keyword-arguments
[14:14] <kushal> kvy_, mark only the required ones as keyword based
[14:14] <kushal> I mean call them with keywords :)
[14:14] <anuGupta> !
[14:15] <kvy_> kushal ok got it
[14:15] <kushal> next
[14:15] <anuGupta> What should we write inside dir() to get list which will contain built in function like __name__ and __main__?
[14:16] <kushal> __name__ or __main__ are not functions
[14:16] <anuGupta> Then?
[14:17] <kvy_> kushal but i want to make my first argument as a keyword and second as a simple variable in same function.
[14:18] <kushal> anuGupta, we will know about them during the modules chapter
[14:18] <kushal> kvy_, you can not do that.
[14:18] <kvy_> kushal ok
[14:19] <ashwanig> kvy_, Don't you think that is useless?
[14:21] <kvy_> ashwanig I don't think so because we got any kind of condition.
[14:23] <kvy_> !
[14:23] <kushal> next
[14:23] <kvy_> This stand for what
[14:23] <kvy_> __name__ == '__main__'

[14:30] <yurii> what means nah   :)
[14:30] <kushal> nope

[14:34] <kvy_> and int too
[14:34] <kvy_> <eof>
[14:35] <avik> kushal, are we supposed to do any problem? just came from college. sorry for interruption!
[14:35] <ashwanig> kvy_, dir is a function and int is data type
[14:36] <kvy_> i mean we does't code dir function than from where it comes.
[14:36] <ashwanig> kvy_, it is a built in function
[14:36] <kvy_> ok
[14:36] <kvy_> got it
[14:39] <yurii> avik :we are  reading   https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html

[13:47] <kushal> no problem
[13:47] <kushal> ashwanig, say you have a module, which as the actual function call addition
[13:47] <kushal> people will import your module and use it.
[13:47] <kushal> But, the addition function needs 24 more modules, and that may change with time.
[13:48] <kushal> So, you have written a few modules which should only be used by the addition function, but not anyone else.
[13:48] <kushal> Then you can replace the code inside, without changing the things below.
[13:48] <kushal> __all__ helps in that

[13:58] <kushal> ashwanig,  wait, slow network
[13:59] <ashwanig> kushal, okay :)
[13:59] <kushal> ashwanig, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/0EFnmt3JxSctVaTyl-4cZg
[13:59] <kushal> say people used add function from bar.py before, now if they use add function from a new bar.py (I gave the name bar2.py for here), they can still use add function
[14:00] <kushal> But the internal code has been changed.
[14:00] <kushal> This is also what we talk about public API.
[14:02] <ashwanig> kushal, so how __all__ helps here?
[14:02] <kushal> ashwanig, this is still stupid example, in a real case, you will only put add in the __all__
[14:02] <kushal> so that people can use that
[14:03] <ashwanig> oh okay. got it
[14:03] <kushal> next
[14:03] <kushal> Anyone else?
[14:03] <kushal> No more questions?
[14:04] <bhavin192> !
[14:04] <kushal> next
[14:05] <bhavin192> It is possible to import a submodule with from name import submodule
[14:05] <kushal> yes
[14:06] <bhavin192> and as well as with import name.submodule are both same?
[14:06] <kushal> yes
[14:06] <kushal> >>> import os.path
[14:06] <kushal> >>> from os import path
[14:06] <kushal> bhavin192, ^^^
[14:07] <bhavin192> kushal, ah! and if we want only one function we can do from os.path import funnmae
[14:07] <kushal> bhavin192, Yes
[14:07] <ashwanig> !
[14:07] <bhavin192> right?
[14:08] <kushal> next
[14:08] <ashwanig> What is the use of private submodules or private functions that are not in __all__ ? They are not accessible right?
[14:08] <bhavin192> ashwanig, you may need them in your public submodules.
[14:09] <maxking> ashwanig: They are accessible, they aren't imported when you do a `from this import *`
[14:09] <maxking> Generally, you should avoid * imports anyway. Just adds too many stuff to the current namespace.
[14:09] <kushal> maxking, and now they will only do from module import * :p
[14:09] <kushal> maxking, I was skipping that :)
[14:10] <ashwanig> maxking, got it
[14:10] <maxking> kushal: oops!
[14:10] <kvy_> !
[14:10] <kushal> maxking, hahaha
[14:10] <kushal> next
[14:10] <kvy_> Hello everyone
[14:10] <kvy_> those who finished reading module and free please help me
[14:10] <kvy_> because of some issue i enable to attend some session so i read logs and practice
[14:10] <kvy_> but i got error in some code
[14:10] <kvy_> will you please help me to solve those error
[14:10] <kvy_> I am sending link of those codes
[14:10] <kvy_> 1. DATA STRUCTURE   https://repl.it/KDN7/8
[14:10] <kvy_> 2. LISTS            https://repl.it/KWZc/3
[14:10] <kvy_> And need some help in these problem
[14:10] <kvy_> 1. MEMORY          https://repl.it/KW0S/1
[14:11] <kushal> kvy_, show only one code, and error, we can help you wit that
[14:11] <kushal> one by one.
[14:11] <kushal> next
[14:12] <kvy_> kushal ok
[14:12] <kushal> kvy_, so show us one, and ask
[14:13] <kvy_> https://repl.it/KDN7/8
[14:13] <kvy_> i am gating error in my this code
[14:14] <kvy_> in line 7
[14:14] <maxking> kvy_: Missing a closing ) in the line 6.
[14:15] <kushal> kvy_, yes, line 6 is the problem
[14:15] <kvy_> kushal maxking got it
[14:15] <bhavin192> kvy_, you have a lot of syntax errors related to print()
[14:16] <devesh_verma> max of them are just the print()
[14:16] <kushal> :)
[14:16] <kvy_> but all my code will work  properly in terminal.
[14:17] <kushal> kvy_, can not be
[14:18] <bhavin192> kvy_, with python3 ?
[14:18] <kvy_> i save hole code in a .py file and than runing .
[14:18] <kvy_> my code will not show any error.
[14:18] <ashwanig> bhavin192, with python2 also it will show error
[14:19] <kvy_> but when i past it here than it is showing error.
[14:19] <devesh_verma> kvy I just tried running your code in my terminal , shows the same errors.
[14:21] <soumam007> kvy_, you are using python less than 3 in terminal
[14:21] <soumam007> but in repl you are using ver. 3
[14:21] <soumam007> i tried it terminal not giving errors in 2.7 but giving for 3
[14:22] <ashwanig> soumam007, I tried it with 2.7.12 I got errors
[14:22] <devesh_verma> I am getting error for both
[14:22] <kvy_> ya i am using python 2.7
[14:23] <soumam007> kvy_, write python3 in the terminal
[14:23] <soumam007> and try asap
[14:23] <kushal> soumam007, :)
[14:23] <kushal> next
[14:23] <soumam007> the errors
[14:23] <kvy_> soumam007 it show python 3.6.1
[14:24] <soumam007> ashwanig, will sort it after class , lets resume
[14:24] <soumam007> kvy_, go for that even
[14:24] <kushal> Now, for Python, we call it batteries included.
[14:24] <kushal> Because the language standard library has a large number of modules for you.
[14:24] <kushal> https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
[14:25] <kvy_> soumam007 ok i will.
[14:27] <kvy_> and i change hole my code but that still show error in line 134
[14:27] <kvy_> here is the link     https://repl.it/KDN7/11
[14:27] <kushal> Next, we will do some quiz, people who already know the answers, please do not answer, it will mostly for new people.
[14:27] <kushal> There is an Operating System module.
[14:27] <kushal> https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
[14:27] <devesh_verma> yeah because the value its getting is string but you have given %d. change it to %s it should solve the issue
[14:28] <devesh_verma> kvy_,
[14:28] <kushal> devesh__verma, Please stop cross talking
[14:28] <devesh_verma> sorry kushal
[14:28] <kushal> From that module, who can tell me the name of the function which can give me the names of all the files inside of a given directory?
[14:29] <kushal> Answer: is in there
[14:29] <anuGupta> May I guess?
[14:31] <kushal> anuGupta, yes please :)
[14:32] <anuGupta> Is it dir()?
[14:32] <knrai> may i
[14:33] <anuGupta> Oops from the link given? I thought you are asking in general
[14:33] <kushal> anuGupta, Nope, dir is a builtin function
[14:33] <kushal> anyone please tell what you read
[14:34] <kvy_> getcwd()
[14:34] <knrai> os.listdir( path )
[14:34] <kushal> kvy_, getcwd tells the current working directory.
[14:34] <ashwanig> it is listdir()
[14:34] <bhavin192> listdir()
[14:34] <kushal> knrai, Correct :)
[14:34] <kushal> yup
[14:34] <kushal> Now, everyone try that out.
[14:35] <soumam007> kushal is it the style of printing str only
[14:35] <soumam007> ?
[14:35] <kushal> soumam007, which is?
[14:35] <soumam007> i thought in that syntax integer values cant be printed
[14:38] <kushal> soumam007, which syntax?
[14:38] <soumam007> sorry that was my misconception, too many formats of printing outputs in python :P
[14:38] <soumam007> kushal i got it ,leave :)
[14:38] <kushal> Okay
[14:38] <kushal> people tried to print all the file names?
[14:38] <ashwanig> yes
[14:39] <san-D> yes
[14:41] <kushal> Okay
[14:41] <kushal> next
[14:41] <kushal> oops
[14:42] <kushal> Try to write one line code, which will print me the name of the terminal emulation you have in your system. Hint: it is inside of an environment variable called TERM
[14:42] <deepika> kushal: echo $0
[14:43] <deepika> ?
[14:43] <kushal> deepika, nope
[14:43] <kushal> deepika, also that is shell :)
[14:44] <kushal> deepika, We are doing Python here.
[14:44] <deepika> Sorry in python yeah
[14:44] <kushal> For example, my terminal is of type xterm-256color
[14:46] <soumam007> kushal do you mean what is that black terminal we are using because i have seen beside by normal terminal i have Xterm
[14:46] <ashwanig> os.environ['TERM']
[14:46] <soumam007> ?
[14:46] <kushal> ashwanig, you should print that :)
[14:46] <bhavin192> print(os.getenv("TERM")) or print(os.environ["TERM"])
[14:46] <kushal> bhavin192, Yup
[14:47] <soumam007> mine is also xterm-256color :)
[14:48] <ashwanig> same here
[14:49] <kvy_> same here
[14:50] <kushal> but now you know how to access any environment variable, correct?
[14:50] <anuGupta> Mine too
[14:51] <ashwanig> yes
[14:51] <kvy_> kushal yes
[14:52] <kushal> What is the bash command to print all the environment variables?
[14:53] <anuGupta> I guess printenv
[14:53] <anuGupta> ?
[14:53] <knrai> printenv
[14:53] <kushal> anuGupta, you can always try it out fast, or search fast, and then answer :p
[14:53] <kushal> No one is stopping you :)
[14:53] <bhavin192> env
[14:53] <kushal> You just have to be fast :)
[14:54] <bhavin192> both are working here env and printenv
[14:54] <kushal> bhavin192, yup
[14:54] <anuGupta> :P

[13:37] <bhavin192> I have seen with statement with other things as well
[13:37] <kushal> bhavin192, Yes.
[13:37] <kvy_> !
[13:37] <bhavin192> kushal, with statement
[13:37] <kushal> bhavin192, all of them have similar use cases, with will take care of many things for you.
[13:37] <kushal> Like closing socket connection or file closing or similar things.
[13:37] <kushal> next
[13:38] <bhavin192> kushal, then how it determines that it has to call the close or other similar methods related to other functions
[13:38] <kushal> bhavin192, I will show later.
[13:38] <kushal> bhavin192, Today, after the session.
[13:38] <kushal> kvy_, question?
[13:38] <kushal> Anyone wants to answer my question?

[13:40] <soumam007> with
[13:41] <kushal> Yup. Thanks.
[13:41] <kvy_> kushal Can we read file in a mode ? <eof>
[13:41] <kushal> kvy_, means?
[13:41] <kushal> you open in Read mode if you want to read.
[13:42] <ashwanig> kvy_, you mean append mode?
[13:42] <kvy_> what if i want to do both.
[13:42] <kvy_> read as well as write.
[13:42] <kushal> kvy_, man 2 open
[13:43] <kushal> kvy_, First read that manual page, search if you have questions, or come here and ask.
[13:43] <kushal> But, first read that man page.
[13:43] <kushal> next
[13:43] <kvy_> kushal ok
[13:43] <kushal> So, the first problem.
[13:44] <kushal> Write a function, when calling it, it will return a tuple, first value is the name of the distribution, second value is the version id of the distribution.
[13:44] <kushal> Hint: read the content of /etc/os-release for the information.

[14:02] <bhavin192> kushal, done. but the notebook is not updating the html preview :-/
[14:02] <ashwanig> kushal, <kushal> Write a function, when calling it, it will return a tuple, first value is the name of the distribution, second value is the version id of the distribution.

[14:04] <kushal> Now try this

[14:04] <kushal> in the notebook server, can you see any difference between fedora and ubuntu os-release file\?
[14:04] <kushal> we will also wait for others
[14:06] <bhavin192> kushal, Ubuntu has double quotes around name and version id
[14:06] <kushal> yes
[14:06] <kushal> so make sure to remove those in your function
[14:06] <kushal> it has to be generic
[14:11] <bhavin192> kushal, done.
[14:11] <kushal> show me the code :)

[14:23] <bhavin192> san-D, knrai you have similar solution. but san-D's code was more readable for me
[14:23] <mbuf> A regex will be faster

[14:28] <ashwanig> samridhia, also you didn't close the file

[14:28] <kushal> brb, changing network
[14:29] <bhavin192> anuG, can't see the solution for this problem. I was facing same issue. https://notebooks.azure.com/anu020815/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[14:29] <ashwanig> anuG, which file?
[14:29] <vivek_> strip() will remove \n and the spaces on left or right. Also, strip("\n") will only remove "\n" even if it sees the spaces. I guess .strip() is better for this
[14:29] <schubisu> mbuf: pm?
[14:30] <ashwanig> vivek_, But there are also quotes "
[14:30] <anuG> ashwanig, summertraining.ipynb
[14:30] <poojaencoded> why my output is showing  ubuntu 16.04.3?
[14:30] <ashwanig> anuG, can't see your solution
[14:30] <avik> samridhia, call the function with a variable. then print the variable. and yes, as ashwanig said close the file, or use 'with' to open the file
[14:31] <vivek_> oh
[14:31] <schubisu> poojaencoded: which machine executes the code?
[14:31] <samridhia> avik , ashwanig trying that.
[14:31] <anuG> ashwanig, still?
[14:31] <bhavin192> poojaencoded, cause Azure Notebooks uses Ubuntu 16.04.3 container images

[14:34] <anuG> :) , ashwanig, how?
[14:35] <kvy_> ashwanig can you check my code  https://repl.it/K3WA/3

[14:36] <avik> glad i could ! :D
[14:37] <anuG> how is that single " within strip removing both at the ends?
[14:38] <bhavin192> samridhia, can't see the solution :( seems like strange problem with Azure notebooks

[14:38] <anuG> yes it will

[14:39] <samridhia> bhavin192, my azure notebook kernel is only working when i restart it again and again wonder why
[14:40] <ashwanig> poojaencoded, you have to call the function right?
[14:40] <bhavin192> samridhia, for me it keeps restarting
[14:40] <kushal> poojaencoded, you will have to call the function :)
[14:40] <kvy_> poojaencoded   you do not print name and version anywhere in the code.
[14:41] <bhavin192> poojaencoded, seems like you are missing '_' while calling.
[14:43] <avik> poojaencoded, run it in terminal or any offline editor, its working. but we needed VERSION_ID, not VERSION
[14:44] <kushal> Next problem, write a function which will tell me the number of cores in your computer
[14:44] <kushal> using /proc/cpuinfo
[14:44] <soumam007> pooja_, has called the function from inside the print fuction
[14:45] <soumam007> it is ok
[14:45] <kvy_> kushal If we call read function twice it give result once why ?
[14:48] <kushal> kvy_, read the python documentation for the same :)
[14:48] <sayan> kushal: you know, the day before I left. I actually had a small accident
[14:48] <kvy_> kushal ok
[14:49] <sayan> was cycling with slippers, and heavy rains and I slipped

[14:52] <ashwanig> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/B1gx1wGxMZtxWB9iSdfhjQ
[14:53] <pooja_> soumam007, i got the output. That time it was not showing because of poor net connection
[14:54] <anuG> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/~SpyLFJIYLcYODRVSd6YhQ
[14:56] <deepika> ashwanig , my /proc/cpuinfo only shows processors and steppings
[14:56] <knrai> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/TiLSeA9tTUOO75NWrYkzAQ
[14:56] <schubisu> anuG: maybe we could stop the loop when cores are found, so it doesn't need to loop to the end
[14:57] <ashwanig> deepika, press Ctrl+F and find 'cores'
[14:57] <anuG> yup, just saw your break :)
[14:58] <san-D> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/y3nTSQA0TT-hbrqz-sW-OA
[14:58] <deepika> ashwanig , okay but for code ?
[14:59] <ashwanig> deepika, didn't get you?
[15:00] <bhavin192> kushal, should it display physical cores?
[15:00] <deepika> ashwanig , no problem , fixed it , thanks :)
[15:00] <thebigj> mbuf: There?
[15:01] <thebigj> Anyone experienced in GRUB?
[15:01] <mbuf> thebigj, yes
[15:01] <thebigj> mbuf: How are you?
[15:02] <thebigj> mbuf: That was yes for There or experienced in GRUB?
[15:02] <mbuf> thebigj, good; ask your question
[15:02] <kushal> thebigj, the session is going on.
[15:02] <kushal> thebigj, please talk in pm.

[15:03] <kushal> bhavin192, to start with, counting total threads will do.
[15:03] <kushal> I want you all the ask and check among yourselves.
[15:03] <san-D> kushal: /proc/cpuinfo shows 4 processors and `cpu cores : 2` for each of them do i need add them all?
[15:03] <kushal> answer is 4
[15:05] <san-D> avik: you code is not updating in notebook
[15:06] <san-D> s/you/your
[15:06] <bhavin192> san-D, seems like we all are facing issue with Azure notebooks :(
[15:08] <kvy_> https://repl.it/JqTv/11   i need someone help
[15:09] <avik> san-D, will fix that. maybe, azure is not autosaving stuff today.
[15:09] <bhavin192> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/B4XyHe8wGi05KAZBkV68EA
[15:09] <bhavin192> avik, even after auto saving the preview is not updating
[15:10] <kushal> kvy_, line.split is not returning two values
[15:10] <kushal> means no : in the line
[15:11] <kvy_> but when i read and print file then it seprated by :
[15:11] <bhavin192> kvy_, may be it is happening at "bugs    :"
[15:12] <ashwanig> bhavin192, why are you counting 'processor'?
[15:13] <kvy_> ya it's printing in  the above way as bhavin192 tells  cpu core    :    2
[15:14] <bhavin192> ashwanig, cause we have to count total virtual cores
[15:14] <knrai> bhavin192: what gives no. of cpu cores
[15:14] <knrai> `cpu cores   :  4` or counting "processor"
[15:15] <kvy_> bhavin192 will you please correct my code.
[15:15] <bhavin192> knrai, cpu cores gives number of physical cores
[15:15] <ashwanig> bhavin192, got it
[15:15] <kvy_> bhavin192 i enable to correct that
[15:16] <kushal> Everyone
[15:16] <ashwanig> bhavin192, the 'cpuinfo' file contains the details for each virtual core one after another right?
[15:16] <kushal> Slowly you will see that many system programs are nothing but fancy way to dealing with configuration files.
[15:16] <bhavin192> kvy_, seems like there are some lines where there is no ":"
[15:16] <bhavin192> ashwanig, IIR
[15:17] <bhavin192> *IIRC yes
[15:17] <kvy_> bhavin192 ok

[13:32] <avik> kushal, may i?
[13:32] <kushal> anyone
[13:32] <avik> https://notebooks.azure.com/technotron/libraries/dgplug/html/summertraining.ipynb
[13:33] <vharsh> kushal, Number of core as in CPU-core?
[13:33] <kushal> avik, ? I can not see any such code in that playbook
[13:33] <kushal> vharsh, Yes
[13:34] <bhavin192> kushal, I want to show the code but I'm having network issues :(
[13:34] <avik> kushal, i am sorry!
[13:35] <avik> i didn't save the other day
[13:35] <kushal> avik, :)
[13:35] <kushal> Anyone else?
[13:35] <kushal> Who else could not do this?
[13:35] <vharsh> kushal, THere's a platform module(I have never used this one) and the regular file system way. Is it okay if I do it directly?
[13:35] <avik> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/-eAFkuNl0at3ONLDUXYWXQ
[13:35] <yurii> i could not do this
[13:36] <kushal> vharsh, we asked to read /proc/cpuinfo file
[13:36] <vharsh> kushal, ok
[13:36] <kushal> yurii, Thanks for telling us.
[13:36] <kushal> yurii, we will do together then.
[13:36] <yurii> fine
[13:36] <ashwanig> kushal, uploading. slow network
[13:37] <ashwanig> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/YKje7LmTv7ggczyfK6shsw
[13:37] <kushal> yurii, here is the /proc/cpuinfo from my computer
[13:38] <kushal> ashwanig, nice :)
[13:38] <kushal> yurii, For each processor there is an entry.
[13:38] <ashwanig> kushal, bhavin192 first did this :)
[13:38] <kushal> yurii, can you tell me how many entries in that?
[13:38] <kushal> count manually
[13:40] <yurii> sorry i do not anderstand what to count
[13:41] <deepika> kushal, I am using a fresh installed fedora in desktop , having issue error in fedora.repo file I guess I updated it , no net running ,tried commenting mirrorlist and uncommenting baseurl
[13:41] <deepika> No luck
[13:42] <kushal> yurii, can you see the lines with "processor" ?
[13:42] <kushal> deepika, we can talk about it after the session
[13:42] <deepika> Sure ,kushal :)
[13:42] <bhavin192> here is my solution to the problem https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/nI8-y40Y6kkO6C0hmE8BRQ
[13:42] <kvy_> kushal i am having some error in code .  https://repl.it/JqTv/11
[13:42] <yurii> kushal - is there any files inside /cpuinfo
[13:42] <anuGupta> Roll call: Anu Kumari Gupta
[13:43] <kushal> yurii, /proc/cpuinfo is a file
[13:43] <kushal> yurii, can you please cat the file in your computer?
[13:43] <yurii> ok
[13:43] <anuGupta> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/~SpyLFJIYLcYODRVSd6YhQ
[13:43] <kushal> kvy_, first problem, you opened the file, but did not close it.
[13:44] <kushal> kvy_, next, not every line has : in it
[13:44] <yurii> i have 4 procassors
[13:44] <kushal> yurii, good, how did you find that?
[13:44] <kvy_> kushal ok i am changing my code.
[13:45] <yurii> proc 0, proc1, proc 2, proc 3
[13:45] <ashwanig> bhavin192, isn't that returning the result without closing the file?
[13:45] <kushal> yurii, now look at the code pasted by ashwanig
[13:45] <bhavin192> ashwanig, as it is using with I think it will take care of that
[13:46] <yurii> yes i so and it is clear now for me
[13:46] <kushal> yurii, or from bhavin192 https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/nI8-y40Y6kkO6C0hmE8BRQ
[13:46] <kushal> Anyone else any question?
[13:46] <yurii> thank you
[13:46] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[13:47] <anuGupta> !
[13:47] <kushal> next
[13:47] <kushal> next
[13:47] <ashwanig> !
[13:47] <sitlanigaurav[m]> how about using os.system("lscpu") ?
[13:47] <anuGupta> Is mine correct?
[13:47] <yurii> !
[13:47] <kushal> sitlanigaurav[m], This case I gave a particular way to find the answer.
[13:47] <kushal> next
[13:47] <ashwanig> anuGupta, no, that's physical cores
[13:48] <kushal> next
[13:48] <ashwanig> kushal, I didn't understand how will with take care of closing the file in bhavin192 code
[13:48] <ashwanig> <eof>
[13:48] <kushal> bhavin192, Do you want to answer ashwanig?
[13:49] <kushal> bhavin192, btw, you don
[13:49] <bhavin192> ashwanig, "with" closes the file as the code block ends
[13:49] <kushal> bhavin192, btw, you don't have to write :param: None
[13:51] <ashwanig> bhavin192, okay, got it
[13:51] <bhavin192> kushal, but still I have similar doubt as ashwanig. if it returns from that block, how it closes the file. Is it something like garbage collection?
[13:52] <kushal> bhavin192, Not like garbage collection, but it closes the file even if there is any error.
[13:52] <kushal> next
[13:52] <yurii> why in some programs we start with #!/usr/bin/env python  and some (like we use as modules) do not
[13:53] <kushal> yurii, good question.
[13:54] <vharsh> http://dpaste.com/038GSYQ.txt
[13:54] <kushal> yurii, Anything which is supposed to be an executable, starts with #! to mention which interpreter to use to for that script.
[13:54] <kushal> Modules are not executable, people import modules into their code, that is why they don't have #!
[13:55] <yurii> ok
[13:56] <kushal> next
[13:57] <kushal> Can we write some more code?
[13:57] <ashwanig> yes
[13:57] <kushal> Okay
[13:58] <vharsh> sure
[13:58] <kvy_> kushal it shows 0 now   https://repl.it/JqTv/12
[13:59] <ashwanig> kvy_, yes because you are updating the `cpu_core` value in each iteration
[14:00] <ashwanig> kvy_, we have to count from the whole file not line by line
[14:01] <kushal> Now, a bit more fancy.
[14:02] <kushal> Write me a code/function, which will take a python file name as input, and then tell me which all modules have been imported in that file.
[14:04] <ashwanig> kushal, the python file will be in the same directory?
[14:04] <kushal> ashwanig, can be in anywhere, we will pass the full path of the file.
[14:05] <ashwanig> kushal, okay
[14:14] <ashwanig> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/Yjj~RpYRNRs3EB6XQhsmcQ
[14:15] <kushal> ashwanig, from os import path
[14:15] <kushal> This case?
[14:15] <ashwanig> oh sorry
[14:15] <kushal> ashwanig, no need to say sorry
[14:15] <kushal> ashwanig, also for, # import os
[14:15] <kushal> :)
[14:16] <vharsh> kushal, http://dpaste.com/2FQTHV0.txt
[14:17] <vharsh> Working on the from os.path import xyz thing now
[14:21] <kushal> You all should show me the first version at leaset
[14:21] <kushal> * least
[14:23] <vharsh> kushal, Should # import os also show up the os module in usages?
[14:23] <kushal> vharsh, nope :)
[14:23] <vharsh> In my program it will not be as line beginswith -> '#'
[14:24] <kushal> vharsh, so what about import os # import sys
[14:24] <kushal> :)
[14:24] <kushal> Everyone please remember, the code does not have to be perfect.
[14:24] <vharsh> kushal, Import sys will be ignored
[14:25] <kushal> vharsh, good
[14:25] <vharsh> kushal, import os#import sys will give weird results.
[14:28] <Ravi> Hello everyone
[14:29] <kushal> Ravi, Hello, a session is going on.
[14:29] <kushal> So please wait for some before we talk here.
[14:31] <vharsh> kushal, http://dpaste.com/18YCZCX.txt this fails for `from os.something.something import hello`
[14:32] <kushal> Okay
[14:33] <kushal> Anyway, we will keep checking the code, and improve slowly.
[14:33] <vharsh> it gives `os.something` as output
[14:33] <kushal> People should make github repos which will contain each problem in a different directory.
[14:33] <kushal> Everyone ^^^^
[14:34] <kushal> Also read this with time https://pymotw.com/3/
[14:34] <kushal> Not everything in one day.
[14:39] <vharsh> kushal, http://dpaste.com/1HAZ4A2.txt
[14:39] <vharsh> Done.
[14:40] <ashwanig> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/qh-nqbtK1DkJ6AMHXzUo1g
[14:40] <kushal> vharsh, i will check
[14:40] <vharsh> I was getting the index of '.' and then getting rid of the `from` keyword.
[14:40] <ashwanig> missing the comment testcase
[14:40] <kushal> vharsh, btw, your code tells me you missed the actual problem statement
[14:40] <kushal> I asked for a function :)
[14:41] <kushal> ashwanig, try to do it without regex
[14:41] <ashwanig> kushal, okay
[14:41] <bhavin192> kushal, I was afk, will do it now
[14:41] <kushal> That is okay.
[14:44] <sitlanigaurav[m]> kushal: in https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/VI2MRl1ZQiFlAL3VIACy7w/ how should i use modules.startswith() ?
[14:45] <kushal> sitlanigaurav[m], even before that, I asked for a function which takes a file path as argument.
[14:46] <sitlanigaurav[m]> I'll update that
[14:46] <vharsh> kushal, http://dpaste.com/15YDD7E.txt Updated :)
[14:47] <ashwanig> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/AtcPy5MXnuEw44BmKpqhwA
[14:47] <kushal> Because we start digging more into the code we are writing.
[14:48] <kushal> I have few more things to say.
[14:48] <kushal> But, I guess people are busy writing code
[14:49] <sitlanigaurav[m]> we're here
[14:49] <kushal> who ever names the function as moduleFinder
[14:49] <kushal> That camelCase is Java style
[14:49] <kushal> In Python do module_finder
[14:49] <kushal> Who all read the ssd.eff.org ?

[14:46] <ashwanig> bhavin192, can you share your code?
[14:47] <bhavin192> ashwanig, sure
[14:47] <kushal> knrai, if you install in the virtualenv, it should not.
[14:47] <kushal> knrai, Also depends on how the software is getting installed
[14:48] <kvy>  kushal here is the error  https://pastebin.com/AfsWYfHq
[14:49] <kushal> let me check
[14:50] <kushal> kvy, Yes, same error here, I think I should update the book with a proper example, that will work in Python2
[14:51] <kvy> ok
[14:52] <kvy> can you tell me when you update that.
[14:53] <kushal> kvy, but do you get the idea? You can install any version if you want.
[14:53] <kvy> ya that's clear to me
[14:54] <bhavin192> Have to go, will read the logs later
[14:58] <kushal> next
[14:58] <kushal> Okay
[14:58] <kushal> Who all does not know anything about HTML?
[14:59] <devesh[m]> kushal, bit of basics
[14:59] <kvy> kushal i know but a little bit.
[15:00] <kushal> basics will do
[15:00] <kushal> For tonight, read this doc https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
[15:01] <deepika> ! One last query on virtual environment
[15:01] <kushal> Then write a function, which will take an URL as argument, and will return all the links from the URL.
[15:01] <kushal> deepika, ask
[15:02] <deepika> Kushal , if I install redid on virt2 it first uninstall the package version installed on virt1 and then install the required version
[15:03] <kushal> deepika, eh, show us the output from the terminal please.
[15:03] <deepika> Okay
[15:04] <deepika> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/pIuyrsTQ/
[15:05] <kvy> deepika it's redis not redid
[15:05] <deepika> kvy , but the point is it should install different versions on different environment
[15:06] <deepika> correct me if i got it wrong :)
[15:07] <ashwanig> deepika, virt1 and virt2 are completely isolated
[15:07] <deepika> i used (virt1) ~/virtual Â» sudo pip3 install redis==2.0.0
[15:08] <deepika> (virt2) ~/virtual Â» sudo pip3 install redis==2.7.1
[15:08] <ashwanig> deepika, that would install redis version 2.0.0 on virt1 and version 2.7.1 on virt2
[15:08] <kvy> ashwanig I try that in my terminal it does not uninstall the first one.
[15:09] <deepika> ashwanig , can sudo cause any trouble ?
[15:09] <ashwanig> kvy, yes it will not uninstall the package in virt1 because it has nothing to do with virt2
[15:09] <kvy> deepika no you got that very clear.
[15:10] <ashwanig> deepika, not sure of that. :)
[15:10] <kushal> deepika, first point, you never gave us the full log.
[15:10] <kushal> ashwanig, point 2, maybe you never deactivated the virt1
[15:11] <kvy> ashwanig but in deepika's terminal why that uninstall first.
[15:12] <deepika> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/PQSFFb8e/
[15:12] <deepika> kushal , sorry , this is thecomplete log
[15:12] <Phi_mb> soumam007, ping?
[15:12] <deepika> :)
[15:15] <kushal> My guess you already install redis 2.7.1 in virt1
[15:15] <kushal> try again
[15:15] <deepika> okay , i'll :)
[15:16] <kushal> Any question on the problem I gave today?
[15:17] <kushal> Okay, we will meet formally again on Monday

[13:28] <rtnpro> This is an informal session today, I am here to take questions on python, unit testing, etc.
[13:28] <bhavin192> rtnpro, roll call?
[13:28] <rtnpro> yes

[13:30] <kvy__> kumar vipin yadav
[13:30] <mdbk> Onyinye Madubuko
[13:31] <rtnpro> cool
[13:31] <rtnpro> do you have any general questions with Python so far?
[13:32] <rtnpro> something you do not understand, etc?
[13:32] <ashwanig> !
[13:35] <rtnpro> next
[13:35] <ashwanig> What is the difference between virtualenv and venv?
[13:35] <rtnpro> AFAIK, they are alias for each other venv == virtual env
[13:35] <anuGupta> !
[13:35] <rtnpro> next
[13:36] <anuGupta> I am unable to use venv
[13:36] <rtnpro> anuGupta, what do you mean?
[13:36] <anuGupta> I am facing issues since last class on virtual environment
[13:37] <rtnpro> anuGupta, what issues? could you paste the error log somewhere?
[13:37] <anuGupta> Yes wait
[13:40] <anuGupta> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/3G6e12ox2tD-IEBhIEfdXw
[13:40] <anuGupta> What might have caused this? I tried installing several things.
[13:41] <ashwanig> anuGupta, it says paste not found
[13:43] <anuGupta> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/tCRgdhkqny1gKXqdwWQkvw
[13:43] <rtnpro> anuGupta, same here, "paste not found"
[13:43] <yurii> Hello friednds, is there eny session today. Sorry for being late
[13:43] <yurii> *friends
[13:44] <rtnpro> yurii, it's just an informal QA session going on right now
[13:44] <rtnpro> anuGupta, why don't you use the 'virtualenv' command directly?
[13:45] <yurii> rtnpro  Thank you
[13:45] <rtnpro> anuGupta, just follow the docs here: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage and you will be good
[13:47] <anuGupta> Oh yes
[13:47] <anuGupta> Got it. Thanks rtnpro
[13:47] <rtnpro> cool
[13:47] <rtnpro> next
[13:49] <rtnpro> shall we try an exercise?
[13:50] <Phi_mb> rtnpro, yes please
[13:50] <bhavin192> rtnpro, yes
[13:50] <rtnpro> cool
[13:51] <sitlanigaurav[m]> Sorry for being late , hi everyone
[13:51] <rtnpro> let's write a program to calculate the nth fibonacci number
[13:52] <rtnpro> can you quickly implement it and share your code, then we'll discuss on it
[13:55] <ashwanig> rtnpro, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/h-jdMDw5Sh0YLfv8YGlpzQ
[13:56] <rtnpro> next, let's calculate the time it takes to run calculate the fibonacci
[13:57] <rtnpro> you can import 'time' and do start = time.time() before calculating the fibonacci number, and post that do, print(time.time() - start)
[14:01] <ashwanig> rtnpro, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/cR1LRdBAUJNsqPtGJSL0BA
[14:04] <rtnpro> ashwanig, now try to alter the value of n, put higher values, 100, 10000, see how it fairs?
[14:04] <ashwanig> rtnpro, stack overflow
[14:04] <rtnpro> ashwanig, also, try to write an iterative solution for the same problem, and compare performances of both implementations for higher values of n and see what performs better
[14:05] <rtnpro> ashwanig, what value of n did you put?
[14:05] <rtnpro> where it err'd out?
[14:05] <ashwanig> rtnpro, 10000
[14:06] <rtnpro> ashwanig, what about 1000?
[14:06] <ashwanig> rtnpro, even with 1000 it is same
[14:07] <rtnpro> ashwanig, what about 500
[14:07] <schubisu> rtnpro: mine is still computing with 100
[14:07] <bhavin192> ashwanig, on azure notebooks it gives me answer for 100000 as well
[14:07] <ashwanig> rtnpro, same as schubisu
[14:08] <ashwanig> bhavin192, same code? or iterative version?
[14:08] <bhavin192> ashwanig, iterative version
[14:08] <bhavin192> here it is https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/vMaBDZT27LVtN-Ez6oy54A
[14:08] <rtnpro> in Python, there's something called a recursion limit
[14:09] <rtnpro> so, the interpreter prevents you from doing indefinite recursion
[14:09] <rtnpro> recursions are costly
[14:09] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[14:10] <rtnpro> every time you recurse, there's a cost of doing a function call, the local variables of the calling function are dumped to stack
[14:10] <rtnpro> new local variables for the called function is created, etc
[14:10] <rtnpro> next
[14:10] <sitlanigaurav[m]> there is a formula mentioned https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/xOzuI1j4HVZlPsyBcwfPag/
[14:10] <ashwanig> !
[14:11] <sitlanigaurav[m]> so according to you it wont give complexity of o (logn) ?
[14:11] <sitlanigaurav[m]> if we use recursion
[14:11] <sitlanigaurav[m]> <eom>
[14:11] <sitlanigaurav[m]> by complexity i mean time complexity
[14:12] <rtnpro> sitlanigaurav[m], I have never spoken about complexity here
[14:12] <rtnpro> it will still give
[14:13] <rtnpro> time is not equal to complexity, it's proportional to it
[14:13] <rtnpro> there are various factors that go in there
[14:13] <sitlanigaurav[m]> rtnpro: So it will compute in less time as compared to sequential ?
[14:13] <rtnpro> sitlanigaurav[m], how?
[14:14] <sitlanigaurav[m]> i mean will it ?
[14:14] <rtnpro> please try to write an iterative version for it and try to examine
[14:14] <sitlanigaurav[m]> sure i'll compare both
[14:14] <rtnpro> cool
[14:15] <rtnpro> let the data speal
[14:15] <rtnpro> speak*
[14:15] <sitlanigaurav[m]> I'll share in a while
[14:15] <bhavin192> ashwanig, can you please run it on azure notebooks?
[14:15] <bhavin192> rtnpro, we will compare my code (iterative) and ashwanig's code
[14:16] <rtnpro> bhavin192, where's your code?
[14:16] <rtnpro> link?
[14:16] <rtnpro> ashwanig, are you done with the iterative implementation?
[14:16] <bhavin192> rtnpro, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/vMaBDZT27LVtN-Ez6oy54A
[14:17] <rtnpro> everyone, don't depend on other's implementation, do your implementation yourself
[14:17] <ashwanig> rtnpro, yes wait
[14:17] <ashwanig> rtnpro, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/duketOjyAI4HnHuROlv94A
[14:18] <rtnpro> now, measure the time consumed across the implementations
[14:20] <rtnpro> what's the runtime for n = 500
[14:24] <ashwanig> rtnpro, tried for n = 30
[14:24] <ashwanig> Iterative is 0.20639681816101074 sec faster
[14:24] <rtnpro> try for bigger numbers
[14:24] <rtnpro> 500
[14:24] <ashwanig> for greater n value it is taking too much time :(
[14:25] <rtnpro> it will take
[14:26] <rtnpro> it will take time, but the iterative solution will return results for n > 1000
[14:26] <rtnpro> lessons learnt...
[14:26] <sitlanigaurav[m]> rtnpro: yeah I'm getting a limit exceeded error with recursion
[14:26] <rtnpro> iterative solutions might not be as pretty as recursive ones, but they are faster
[14:27] <rtnpro> sitlanigaurav[m], try with iterative approach
[14:27] <sitlanigaurav[m]> lesson learned
[14:27] <rtnpro> it's because of the function calls happening
[14:27] <rtnpro> a function call has a cost
[14:28] <sitlanigaurav[m]> shall i share that error?
[14:28] <rtnpro> so, when you write big programs, it makes sense to break it into smaller functions, but don't overdo it
[14:28] <rtnpro> don't nest function calls too deep
[14:28] <rtnpro> else, it might slow things down
[14:28] <rtnpro> sitlanigaurav[m], not required
[14:29] <rtnpro> sitlanigaurav[m], you can google about the error and read about it
[14:29] <rtnpro> the objective is to keep things lean and simple
[14:29] <rtnpro> you will learn these by writing a lot of code, when you hit problems, and when you fix them
[14:30] <rtnpro> that's all from my side, for today

[16:57] <kushal> Thank you everyone.
[16:58] <kushal> Today we have warthog9 with us for a guest session.
[16:58] <jasonbraganza> hello warthog9! and good morning!
[16:58] <kushal> As usual you can type ! if you have any questions, warthog9 will take them as he wish.
[16:58] <kushal> next
[16:58] <kushal> next
[16:58] <kushal> Okay, queue is now cleared.
[16:58] <kushal> warthog9, Stage is now yours, feel free to introduce yourself as you wish :)
[16:59] <warthog9> well since they wouldn't let me introduce myself as this when I was over in Pune for PyCon I'm Terri Oda's +1 to Python events ;-)
[17:00] <jasonbraganza> :)
[17:00] <warthog9> but I've been running around in open source circles since about 1995 or so, mostly Linux
[17:01] <warthog9> ran kernel.org for nearly a decade, git developer for a while mostly working on gitweb (is it dead yet? please let gitweb be dead!), I've done a bunch of stuff in network booting with pxe / gpxe / ipxe / etherboot
[17:01] <warthog9> worked for Intel on the minnowboard open source hardware platform for a few years, and now I work for VMware in their Open Source Program Office
[17:02] <warthog9> beyond that in my spare time I buld robot dots, space ship bridges, random open source hardware projects, bodge fix my home's heat pump, mow the lawn and expecting our first child in the next week and a day
[17:03] <jasonbraganza> congratulations!
[17:03] <warthog9> I'll have a freak out about the upcoming NMI SIGCHILD later no that I noticed the date ;-)
[17:03] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[17:04] <kushal> add: warthog9
[17:04] <warthog9> next
[17:04] <sitlanigaurav[m]> Are you a star wars fan ?
[17:04] <sitlanigaurav[m]> :D
[17:05] <mbuf> !
[17:05] <warthog9> preferential towards star trek myself, but I do enjoy star wars
[17:05] <warthog9> bonus points now that George Lucas has had his hands torn away from the sript writing, and they are are starting to explore the greater *chuckle* universe
[17:06] <warthog9> though if I could bring firefly back, I would jump on that :-)
[17:06] <warthog9> next
[17:06] <sitlanigaurav[m]> it was mentioned in your profile that you turned to the dark side.<eom>
[17:06] <mbuf> warthog9, What is your view on the state of Open Source Hardware licenses?
[17:07] <warthog9> mbuf: so we've had a good long while to figure out a lot of the legalities going on about software
[17:07] <warthog9> and while hardware has been around longer, it's a lot more complicate from a legal perspective
[17:08] <warthog9> right now I'd argue we are in the stage just trying to flounder around and use what tools we have, while we try to figure out what tools we need
[17:08] <mbuf> warthog9, okay
[17:08] <warthog9> :-)
[17:08] <mbuf> warthog9, thanks!
[17:08] <warthog9> next
[17:08] <mbuf> !
[17:08] <warthog9> next
[17:09] <mbuf> warthog9, do you still use Perl today, and for what purpose?
[17:09] <warthog9> much to the chagrin of my boss: yes I still use perl ;-)
[17:09] <warthog9> perl is the swiss army chainsaw of the programming world, it can do everything but it might take your arm off when you use it
[17:10] <warthog9> lately I've been using it because the GitHub API library is the least bad in perl, outside the official libraries
[17:10] <girish946> !
[17:10] <warthog9> though, that's not to say that I didn't try to use the python one
[17:10] <mbuf> warthog9, okay
[17:10] <mbuf> !
[17:11] <warthog9> I just couldn't get it to work for what I wanted fast enough, so to perl I went ;-)
[17:11] <jasonbraganza> !
[17:11] <warthog9> next
[17:11] <girish946> hello warthog, have you worked with arduino due? if yes, How do you flash the binary into it? I've been trying this the whole week but could not get it done. thank you!
[17:11] <warthog9> I haven't poked at a due in a while, do you have the arduino ide?
[17:11] <girish946> yes
[17:12] <warthog9> or are you trying to use avrdude directly?
[17:12] <warthog9> make sure you've set the board options under 'Tools' in the menu bar correctly
[17:12] <girish946> no, due uses some proprietary bootloader. for that there is a tool called bossac.
[17:12] <warthog9> and you *MIGHT* need to change the permissions on the /dev/ entry so a normal user can write to it
[17:12] <warthog9> or you might just need to flash via root
[17:13] <girish946> yes. I tried running this as root.
[17:13] <warthog9> and no luck?
[17:13] <girish946> yes.
[17:14] <warthog9> sadly, I don't know - I'd have to go find my due to remember what I did the last time I poked at it
[17:14] <girish946> the tool "bossac" doesn't recognize the board.
[17:14] <girish946> ok.
[17:14] <warthog9> I've had my head down in the esp8266 and esp32 based systems too much lately
[17:14] <warthog9> and the attiny85s
[17:14] <girish946> I've just got my esp32.
[17:15] <girish946> trying zephyr on it.
[17:15] <warthog9> when you get tired of zephyr try micropython ;-)
[17:15] <warthog9> next
[17:15] <mbuf> warthog9, if you wanted hardware work to be done by dgplug, what work would you prefer to "out-source"? :)
[17:16] <girish946> sure. thank you :)
[17:16] <warthog9> I think the most helpful thing that dgplug could do is track down a good board house and assembly manufacturer that's indie India
[17:17] <warthog9> s/indie/inside/
[17:17] <mbuf> warthog9, anything specific you want from them?
[17:17] <warthog9> India, and Brazil, have insanely insular import rules that make getting hardware into the country harder, and finding a place inside India that can build things may make it easier to get your hands on hardware
[17:18] <mbuf> warthog9, got it; thanks!
[17:18] <warthog9> and there's plenty of open source hardware designs to throw at the board houses and assemply places.  The more hardware you have cheap access to, the more you'll play and experiment
[17:18] <warthog9> and honestly playing with things and experimenting is how you'll learn and grow and do more cool things :-)
[17:18] <warthog9> next
[17:18] <jasonbraganza> A broad brush on the state of open source hardware today? Is it possible yet to have the âfreeâ patent unencumbered machine that RMS wants?
[17:19] <warthog9> that rms wants: no
[17:19] <warthog9> open source hardware is actually in pretty good shape I'd argue
[17:19] <warthog9> manufacturers already want to make their chips and parts accessible, and they've (generally) done a good job of that for a very long time
[17:20] <jasonbraganza> true
[17:20] <warthog9> but at the end of the day a lot of those chips are going to be proprietary, and for fairly good reason - once someone else can trivially clone what you are doing, they'll do it cheaper / better / faster
[17:20] <warthog9> and those are designs that companies can sink crazy amounts of money into
[17:21] <warthog9> the FTDI serial stuff is a good example of what' happened in the clone wars there
[17:21] <jasonbraganza> so whither the âopen sourceâ part of hardware then?
[17:21] <warthog9> with FTDI going so far as to try and brick some of their cloned hardware, which was a poor move
[17:21] <warthog9> jasonbraganza: the "open source" part is how you put the pieces together
[17:21] <jasonbraganza> aaah
[17:22] <warthog9> it's like saying the screws and wood are proprietary, but the blue prints to build your house are open source
[17:22] <jasonbraganza> now the pieces fit :) thank you!
[17:22] <warthog9> so while we all have to buy the screws, you could add another bathroom to my design when you build your house
[17:23] <jasonbraganza> warthog9 - so I could design stuff of my own or freely use someone elseâs design, correct?
[17:23] <warthog9> correct
[17:23] <warthog9> I've got several designs up
[17:23] <jasonbraganza> thank you <eom>
[17:23] <warthog9> the bunnies I did for pycon pune are up at https://github.com/unreproducible/battlebunnies
[17:23] <warthog9> and there's a few soldering kits in my main github.com/warthog9 account
[17:24] <warthog9> next
[17:24] <jasonbraganza> was wondering how terriko was playing around with her laser beam toy and now that I realise youâre the plus one - it all makes sense :)
[17:25] <warthog9> the laser is awesome, even if it is taking up 1/3 of our dining room table right now ;-)
[17:25] <jasonbraganza> hahahahahaha
[17:25] <warthog9> the thing is huge though, it's like 2.5 x 3ish feet?
[17:26] <warthog9> and we don't have all of it yet either, as there's a filter system that's still coming that goes underneath it so you don't have to vent it outside while it's cutting
[17:26] <girish946> !
[17:26] <warthog9> next
[17:26] <girish946> warthg9, could you suggest any controller from esp that is good for dsp (I need to calculate fft of 512 samples/sec).
[17:26] <warthog9> gut reaction would be to go for the esp32
[17:27] <warthog9> it's dual core and quite a bit faster than the 8266
[17:27] <girish946> ok. I'll try that.
[17:27] <jasonbraganza> !
[17:27] <warthog9> has more flash memory and ram too
[17:27] <warthog9> http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview
[17:28] <warthog9> and if you are looking for a test board there's a nodemcu like board that's floating around with the esp32 on it, that would be a good starting point
[17:28] <warthog9> next
[17:28] <jasonbraganza> btw, I so loved your pycon video!
[17:28] <jasonbraganza> Started my career as a hardware monkey with breadboards and assembling telephone anaylizers back in â97, before I got into IT/PC support
[17:28] <jasonbraganza> I joined up here at dgplug, so that I could learn software.
[17:28] <jasonbraganza> If I want to get back into the hardware game, whatâll I find different from 20 years ago?
[17:28] <warthog9> jasonbraganza: nothing ;-)
[17:29] <jasonbraganza> really?
[17:29] <warthog9> the tools have had a vague face lift, but really the industry hadn't changed much
[17:29] <jasonbraganza> 6502s and assembler?!
[17:29] <warthog9> well, ok we have come a little way on that front ;-)
[17:29] <warthog9> mcu's have gotten faster and cheaper
[17:29] <jasonbraganza> india was a bit behind the times then :P
[17:30] <warthog9> the design tools are all still unapproachable messes
[17:30] <warthog9> getting small runs of boards has actually gotten a LOT easier very recently
[17:30] <jasonbraganza> nice!
[17:30] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[17:31] <warthog9> but a lot of the chips and designs you'll remember from 1997 are still floating around
[17:31] <warthog9> sometimes with wifi bolted to the side now ;-)
[17:31] <warthog9> next
[17:31] <jasonbraganza> woah!
[17:31] <jasonbraganza> thank you :)
[17:31] <sitlanigaurav[m]> For a beginner can you recommend which hardware to pick up for learning , and where to start learning assembly level programming?
[17:32] <avik> !
[17:32] <warthog9> I'm going to sound like a broken record, or a sales agent for esperif soon, but go look at the esp8266 or the esp32
[17:33] <warthog9> you can write the raw assembly for it if you want, but you can also jump up into more friendly high level languges like python or lua
[17:33] <warthog9> or even arduino
[17:33] <warthog9> the boards are pretty flexible, and relatively easy to deal with so they are pretty approachable
[17:34] <warthog9> and they tend to run about 1/3 the cost of an official arduino
[17:34] <warthog9> so that's the direction I've been pointing folks in :-)
[17:34] <warthog9> next
[17:34] <avik> the esp8266 you gave at pycon was my first hardware to play with! If I want to upgrade, will audrino uno be better or microbit?
[17:35] <avik> to be honest, i have no idea about  any of them!
[17:35] <warthog9> depends on what you mean by 'upgrade'
[17:35] <warthog9> the uno and the microbit, from a pure hardware perspective, would actually both be downgrades
[17:35] <avik> ok! so?
[17:35] <girish946> !
[17:35] <warthog9> the microbit has some nice sensors and more leds on it, and it's got a good community behind it so there's some nice things going on there
[17:36] <warthog9> the uno is just a very tried and true, everyone has used it, platform
[17:36] <warthog9> but the mcu's on both are slower, less ram, and less nvflash
[17:36] <warthog9> vs. the esp8266 board from pycon pune
[17:37] <avik> okay, so what do you suggest?
[17:37] <warthog9> as an upgrade? the esp32, after that you are likely looking at something like the sama 5
[17:37] <warthog9> but you jump a lot in price going to the sama 5
[17:37] <warthog9> the official pyboard would be a big step up, but it's also a big step up in price
[17:38] <avik> hehe, okay! thanks a lot! will keep in mind! <eof>
[17:38] <warthog9> next
[17:38] <girish946> could you tell us more about the open source hardware projects that you are currently working on?
[17:39] <warthog9> gotta think of which ones are public knowledge yet ;-)
[17:39] <warthog9> I did just finish up a soldering kit for a maker faire out here, surface mount, and it uses an attiny85 as the brains
[17:40] <warthog9> hardware isn't super complicated, but it's a soldering kit so people had fun with it a couple of weeks ago
[17:40] <warthog9> I've got a gen2 of the bunnies I did 95% complete, I've been holding off ordering a second round of prototypes on that till I've confirmed that I had IR working
[17:41] <girish946> great. is that project public yet? can I see it some where?
[17:41] <girish946> the one with attiny85
[17:41] <warthog9> the bunnies are public, https://github.com/unreproducible/battlebunnies
[17:41] <warthog9> ohhh yeah that one is
[17:42] <warthog9> https://github.com/warthog9/ABQMMF-Solderkit-2016 <-- that's last years that's through hole
[17:42] <warthog9> https://github.com/warthog9/ABQMMF-Solderkit-2017 <-- that's this years which is all surface mount
[17:42] <warthog9> I need to start on a 2018 one that will be a road runner, but I haven't decided if it'll be through hole or surface mount
[17:43] <warthog9> have some iot sensor things (temperature, light, etc) I've got mostly done that I need to do prototypes of before I release
[17:43] <girish946> okay.
[17:43] <girish946> also bunnies are great. I'm still using it.
[17:43] <warthog9> mostly things happen when I've got time, and I suspect I'll have a time sink happening soon ;-)
[17:43] <warthog9> GOOD!
[17:43] <warthog9> I'm glad :-)
[17:44] <girish946> :)
[17:44] <warthog9> the bunnies were intended to be approachable and useful, and I keep hearing that people are still using them - so I'm pretty pleased :-)
[17:44] <warthog9> next
[17:45] <girish946> so in  this version  of bunnies does the issue regarding IR sensor is solved?
[17:45] <warthog9> girish946: maybe
[17:45] <warthog9> I haven't tested it yet which is the problem :-P
[17:45] <sitlanigaurav[m]> !
[17:45] <warthog9> adafruit sent me a box with an mp3 player kit in it that uses IR and I want to get that working, then test the code on the bunny to confirm
[17:45] <girish946> ok no problem. all the other things are still working.
[17:45] <warthog9> next
[17:46] <sitlanigaurav[m]> You told us that you ran kernel.org , what did you work on regarding kernel?
[17:46] <warthog9> I ran the infrastructure actually
[17:47] <jasonbraganza> so cool!
[17:47] <warthog9> I think my name shows up once, maybe twice, in the changelog for the kernel - but otherwise I ran the infrastrucre it was all based on
[17:47] <warthog9> so we had world wide mirroring, geodns load distribution
[17:47] <mbuf> !
[17:47] <sitlanigaurav[m]> devops right?
[17:48] <warthog9> that's as close a term as exists for what I did
[17:48] <warthog9> more systems architect, sysadmin, beggar, and coder all rolled into one job
[17:48] <jasonbraganza> that was going to be my question :P
[17:49] <warthog9> next
[17:49] <jasonbraganza> !
[17:49] <sitlanigaurav[m]> Aww, Cool
[17:49] <mbuf> what are the reading material(s) or resources you would recommend for someone getting started in Site Reliability Engineering?
[17:49] <mbuf> warthog9, ^^
[17:49] <warthog9> I'd start by building your own infrastructure and getting it working
[17:50] <warthog9> I've always been one to build it, tear it apart, rebuild it till I understand it
[17:50] <warthog9> so I don't know of too many things to suggest reading outside of howtos and the documentation for the various pieces you are trying to make work
[17:50] <mbuf> warthog9, okay
[17:51] <warthog9> but yeah, get a small machine you can break, and then start breaking it :-)
[17:51] <warthog9> next
[17:51] <jasonbraganza> how was kernel.org funded (and you paid) in those early days?
[17:51] <mbuf> warthog9, got it! thanks!
[17:51] <warthog9> in the early days? we begged, and borrowed basically :-)
[17:51] <warthog9> and none of us were paid
[17:52] <jasonbraganza> holy moly!
[17:52] <warthog9> we ran the infrastructure in our spare time on donations till the Linux Foundation hired me in, grief I don't remember when?
[17:52] <warthog9> 2009?
[17:52] <warthog9> earlier than that
[17:53] <warthog9> you know it's bad when you have to go look up your own linkedin profile ;-)
[17:53] <sitlanigaurav[m]> 2008, mentioned on your linkedin
[17:53] <jasonbraganza> holy long decade batman!
[17:53] <kushal> !
[17:53] <warthog9> so yeah, kernel.org ran from it's inception till when I was hired without fulltime staff
[17:53] <warthog9> and all the hardware, and hosting, was donated
[17:53] <jasonbraganza> why do it?
[17:53] <jasonbraganza> what kept you going?
[17:54] <warthog9> so I spent, in some cases, upwards of a year working on the donation deals for hardware
[17:54] <warthog9> I enjoyed it :-)
[17:54] <warthog9> when I went to the Linux Foundation I took a small paycut to keep doing it, but full time
[17:54] <warthog9> (for the record: don't do that, it's crazy talk!)
[17:55] <warthog9> next
[17:55] <jasonbraganza> i did and youâre right :)
[17:56] <kushal> warthog9, Can you please explain a bit more on how to learn at home? Say someone wants to be good at infrastructure, what kind of minimum setup, and then what all things that person can try at home.
[17:56] <kushal> Most participants of the training are new.
[17:56] <warthog9> there's two ways to do the learning at home
[17:57] <warthog9> (1) take what you've got and start breaking it, you'll be very motivated to fix it as this will usually mean your internet is broken ;-)
[17:57] <warthog9> (2) build up a parallel setup, using cheap parts, that you don't mind breaking the setup on
[17:57] <warthog9> but snag a Linux box and get a website, internally, up and running
[17:57] <kushal> Please explain breaking otherwise people may break the real hardware.
[17:57] <warthog9> lol, yeah don't break your hardware in half
[17:58] <warthog9> breaking as in experimenting, trying to bring up things you've never tried running
[17:58] <warthog9> like running a mail server, bringing up apache or nginx
[17:58] <warthog9> runs some virtual machines and build out a load balancer
[17:58] <warthog9> virtual machines are great for experimenting and playing with
[17:58] <warthog9> since they are easy to put up, and tear down
[17:58] <sitlanigaurav[m]> what hardware do we need?
[17:59] <warthog9> anything you've got
[17:59] <jasonbraganza> !
[17:59] <kushal> sitlanigaurav[m], your laptop is good enough for vms
[17:59] <warthog9> the older and crappier the hardware the more you'll have to think about how to put it together to do what you want :-)
[18:00] <warthog9> kushal: does that answer your question?
[18:00] <warthog9> next
[18:00] <jasonbraganza> a day in the life of John Hawley (before the craziness of the coming year) :P What routines, if any keep you sane? motivated?
[18:01] <warthog9> kushal can tack on if I didn't answer his question
[18:01] <kushal> warthog9, yes, sorry, EOF
[18:01] <bkero> (It was asked earlier, I had to do some digging, just found now)
[18:02] <warthog9> my day likely isn't that far different than yours - I wake up go to work, though I work from home now
[18:02] <warthog9> the work itself is fun so that tends to keep me motivited
[18:02] <avik> !
[18:02] <warthog9> since I work from home I force myself to leave the house at least once a day
[18:03] <warthog9> evrnings are where the weird projects tend to spill into, like building robots and starship bridges
[18:03] <warthog9> and there tends to be random crossover between my fun projects and work too so my work / life lines are a bit blurry
[18:03] <warthog9> which is also not sometihng I generally recommend
[18:04] <warthog9> but carve out some time to play with things
[18:04] <warthog9> doesn't matter what, go play with technology
[18:04] <warthog9> next
[18:04] <avik> just a quick question, is there any non-paid option for vmware?
[18:04] <jasonbraganza> Thank you!
[18:04] <warthog9> player I think is the only free thing we've got
[18:04] <warthog9> from a VM perspective
[18:05] <avik> okay, is that good enough for starters?
[18:05] <warthog9> think you can grab esxi free as well, but you don't get all the extra management pieces around the edge
[18:05] <warthog9> yes, they'll get you moving
[18:05] <avik> okay, thank you<eom>
[18:06] <warthog9> if you run into needing some feature that you'd have to pay for, but is available via qemu/kvm, or any other virtual solution - swtich to it
[18:06] <warthog9> next
[18:06] <warthog9> also if you run into neededing something in a vmware product, let me know so I can pass along the "the community sure would like to use $feature" to the product teams ;-)
[18:07] <avik> okay that would be awesome! thank you!
[18:08] <warthog9> anything else?
[18:08] <warthog9> I'm happy to answer any question
[18:08] <mbuf> warthog9, thanks for your time and for sharing your know-how; congratulations once again!
[18:09] <jasonbraganza> i second mbuf! :)
[18:09] <sitlanigaurav[m]> warthog9: it was amazing to hear from you and sharing stuff
[18:10] <warthog9> well before I let you guys all crash for the night let me encourage you to go play, experiment, and try things outside your comfort levels
[18:10] <bhavin192> warthog9, Thank you :)
[18:10] <warthog9> the more you poke around, trying new things, the more you'll learn
[18:10] <cyber_freak> !
[18:10] <sitlanigaurav[m]> i have got a spare router to break :p
[18:10] <warthog9> and seriously, you won't learn until you've broken something ;-)
[18:10] <warthog9> so go out there and break things :-)
[18:11] <warthog9> next
[18:12] <warthog9> I mean, I know next to nothing about heating and cooling systems and yet I'm going to go try and fix ours when I get done here ;-) What's the worst that could go wrong? ;-)
[18:12] <warthog9> note to self: step #1 TURN THE POWER OFF
[18:12] <cyber_freak> Hi warthog9 , What would you recommend to a noob user of ESP8266 , I will be getting mine yesterday. Some beginner projects to get started ?
[18:13] <warthog9> cyber_freak: get sometihng like micropython loaded up on the board, and then start blinking leds
[18:13] <cyber_freak> s/yesterday/tomorrow
[18:13] <warthog9> you could follow anwesha's write up on getting her bunny to blink from twitter
[18:13] <warthog9> and there's usually an led or two on an esp8266, you could do that :-)
[18:14] <warthog9> it's fun and goofy
[18:14] <warthog9> but it's a good starting place
[18:14] <warthog9> then expand from there
[18:14] <bhavin192> warthog9, I have broken esp8266 :( used Tx Rx from Arduino directly
[18:15] <cyber_freak> Thanks warthog9
[18:15] <warthog9> if you haven't tried it, take a look at: https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html
[18:15] <warthog9> that should run you through the basics for more or less any esp8266 and micropython
[18:15] <warthog9> and micropython is REALLY easy to walk up to for an MCU
[18:15] <kushal> There is also http://micropython-on-esp8266-workshop.readthedocs.io/
[18:16] <cyber_freak> Yes I was going through it just before the session .
[18:16] <warthog9> we also did https://github.com/unreproducible/tinysnakes but we stole a lot of it from otherplaces
[18:16] <cyber_freak> thanks kushal , will be starting with the docs really soon
[18:17] <warthog9> go play with things, don't be afraid of failure, don't be afraid to break things - if you break it *FIX IT* :-)
[18:17] <warthog9> you'll learn a LOT more from fixing things, than from getting it right the first time
[18:18] <warthog9> bhavin192: learned a valuable lesson, though I'm not sure he can fix it
[18:18] <warthog9> but I bet bhavin192 won't make that mistake again ;-)
[18:18] <bhavin192> warthog9, hehe yup :D
[18:18] <warthog9> for the record i have stacks of boards I've broken in similar ways, don't feel bad at all
[18:19] <girish946> !
[18:20] <warthog9> next
[18:20] <girish946> warthog9, how often do you see the magic smoke? while making/breaking the things :D
[18:21] <warthog9> well my house was sparking last night, so.....
[18:21] <warthog9> the more you do this, the less you'll magic smoke things
[18:21] <girish946> right. :)
[18:21] <warthog9> but you have to let the magic smoke out a few times to know not to connect a 5v rx/tx to a 3.3v input line ;-)
[18:22] <girish946> ha ha. yes :D
[18:22] <kushal> warthog9, Thank you for the session :)
[18:22] <warthog9> :-)
[18:22] <girish946> <eom?
[18:22] <warthog9> you are welcome
[18:22] <warthog9> <EOF>
[18:23] <kushal> This is warthog9's talk from PyCon Pune https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uBEEjOrTms
[18:23] <girish946> thank you warthog9 :)
[18:23] <warthog9> you are all very welcome :-)
[18:23] <kushal> warthog9, Thank you once again :)
